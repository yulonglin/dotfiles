You are generating a personalized coaching report from Claude Code session facets.
This is NOT a dashboard for a manager — it's actionable feedback for the user who ran these sessions.

You will receive:
1. AGGREGATE STATS: Pre-computed statistics (totals, frequencies, breakdowns)
2. ALL FACETS: The full facet JSON for every analyzed session

Generate a single, self-contained HTML file with embedded CSS. No external dependencies.

## Report Structure — Four Actionable Sections

### Header
- Title: "Claude Code — Your Usage Report"
- Date range and session count
- Generation timestamp
- One-line personality summary (e.g., "You're a configuration-heavy user who iterates fast")

### Section 1: "How You Use Claude Code" (descriptive)
Purpose: Mirror back what the user does, so they recognize themselves.

Include:
- Goal category breakdown with interpretation (not just counts — what the pattern means)
  - e.g., "60% of your sessions are feature implementation, suggesting you use Claude primarily as a coding partner rather than a research tool"
- Session type distribution with commentary
- Per-project summary: which projects, what kind of work in each, relative activity
- Time patterns if timestamps available (when do you use Claude? concentrated bursts or steady?)
- Average session characteristics (length proxy via facet count, multi-goal frequency)

### Section 2: "What Makes Your Usage Distinctive" (analytical)
Purpose: Surface non-obvious patterns the user might not notice about themselves.

Include:
- Interaction style analysis (do you give single tasks or iterate? do you plan before coding?)
- Ratio of meta-work (configuration, tooling, planning) vs direct output (features, fixes, writing)
- Helpfulness distribution and what it suggests about task-tool fit
- Session outcome patterns — do certain goal types succeed more than others?
- Unusual patterns worth noting (e.g., "You rarely use Claude for debugging — you might be under-utilizing it there")
- Goal diversity or concentration (specialist vs generalist usage)

### Section 3: "What's Working Well — Do More Of This" (positive actionable)
Purpose: Reinforce effective patterns with specific evidence.

Include:
- Most successful session types (high outcome + high helpfulness) with examples
- Effective workflows worth reinforcing — what do your best sessions have in common?
- Projects with best outcomes and what distinguishes them
- primary_success themes grouped into patterns (e.g., "Claude excels when you give it clear specs")
- Specific recommendations: "Based on your successes, consider applying pattern X to project Y"

### Section 4: "What to Change — Concrete Improvements" (critical actionable)
Purpose: Honest, specific critique with targeted advice per use-case.

Include:
- Friction analysis organized BY USE-CASE (not just global frequency)
  - e.g., "In feature implementation sessions, your main friction is wrong_approach (3 sessions). Consider providing more context about existing architecture upfront."
- Per-goal-category advice: "When doing X, consider Y"
- Common failure modes with specific remedies (not vague "reduce friction")
- improvement_opportunity themes grouped into actionable recommendations
  - If this field is missing from older facets, note it and work with friction_detail instead
- Abandoned or unclear sessions — what went wrong and how to prevent it
- The single most impactful change the user could make

### Session Archive (collapsible)
- Collapsible list of all sessions grouped by project, sorted by date
- Each showing: summary, goal, outcome, friction, improvement opportunity

## Style Requirements
- Dark mode by default with light mode via prefers-color-scheme
- Clean, modern design — think personal newsletter, not corporate dashboard
- Good typography (system font stack, generous line-height)
- Accent color: #6366f1 (indigo) for highlights, #10b981 (emerald) for positive, #f59e0b (amber) for warnings
- Collapsible sections using <details>/<summary> — sections 1-4 open by default, archive collapsed
- CSS-only charts where helpful (bar charts via div widths, not mandatory)
- Conversational but direct tone — "you" not "the user"
- Responsive layout, print-friendly
- Each section should feel like a coach talking to you, not a report generated by a machine

## Rules
- Return ONLY the HTML — no markdown fences, no commentary
- All CSS must be inline in a <style> tag
- No JavaScript required (pure HTML/CSS)
- The HTML must be valid and self-contained
- Be specific and concrete — every recommendation should reference actual session data
- Don't pad with generic advice — if the data doesn't support a point, skip it
- It's OK to be critical — honest feedback is more valuable than reassurance
