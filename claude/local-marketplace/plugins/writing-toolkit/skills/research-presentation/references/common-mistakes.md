# Common Mistakes to Avoid

## 1. Burying the lede
- ❌ 10 slides of background before showing results
- ✅ Slide 1 = outcome, Slides 2+ = details

## 2. Ambiguous outcomes
- ❌ "We got 67% accuracy"
- ✅ "Success: 67% accuracy (baseline 50%, target >60%)"

## 3. Missing prompts
- ❌ "We measured refusal rate"
- ✅ "Refusal rate using prompt: [show prompt]"

## 4. Unclear visualizations
- ❌ 8 overlapping lines, tiny font, no error bars
- ✅ 2-3 key comparisons, large fonts, confidence intervals

## 5. No time prioritization
- ❌ Equal time on all topics, run out of time before critical decision
- ✅ Agenda with time allocations, priority-ordered

## 6. Overloading with details
- ❌ Every hyperparameter, every experiment variant
- ✅ Main findings + "details in backup slides if needed"

## 7. No baselines
- ❌ "Method A: 75%"
- ✅ "Method A: 75% (baseline: 50%, SOTA: 82%)"
