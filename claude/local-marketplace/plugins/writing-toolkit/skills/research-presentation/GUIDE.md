# Research Presentation Guide

## Critique Framework

For each slide or section, evaluate:
1. **Clarity** - Can someone understand this in 5 seconds?
2. **Structure** - Is information ordered for comprehension?
3. **Completeness** - Is context sufficient but not excessive?
4. **Visual clarity** - Do visuals aid or hinder understanding?

### Critique Output Format
```
## Slide X: [Title]
**Issue**: [Describe the clarity problem]
**Why it matters**: [Impact on audience understanding]
**Suggestion**: [Specific rewrite or restructure]

Before: "We got 67% accuracy on the task"
After: "Success: 67% accuracy (baseline 50%, target >60%)"
```

## Core Principles

### 1. Summary-First Structure
**Lead with outcomes, not setup.**
```
Slide 1: Executive Summary
- Recap of previous meeting takeaways
- What you did since then
- Outcome: Success or failure (be explicit)
- Key decision needed (if any)
```

### 2. Explicit Success/Failure Framing
**Never leave your mentor guessing whether results are good or bad.**
- ✅ "Experiment succeeded: 94% accuracy (baseline: 50%)"
- ❌ "Results: 52% accuracy" (is this good or bad?)

### 3. Include an Agenda with Time Allocations
Prioritize discussion items over updates.

### 4. Prioritize by Importance
1. Blocking decisions needed
2. Surprising results requiring discussion
3. Successful experiments (sanity check)
4. Failed experiments (if debugging needed)

### 5. Always Include Your Prompt (AI Research)
- **Main slides**: Show truncated prompt
- **Appendix**: Include full prompt verbatim

## Graph Selection Framework
1. **What story am I telling?** (Comparison, Trend, Distribution, Relationship)
2. **What's important for understanding?** (Main effect, Uncertainty, Baselines)
3. **What can I remove?** (Chart junk, legends if direct labeling possible)
