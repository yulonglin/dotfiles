# Common Scenarios

## Rental Negotiations

**Lead with tactical empathy:**
1. Label their concerns: "It sounds like 6 months gives you the financial stability you need"
2. Acknowledge their interests: "I imagine re-listing in winter is something you'd rather avoid"
3. State your need clearly: "I'm looking for a 3.5 month rental through February"
4. Collaborate with calibrated question: "How could we make a shorter-term work for you?"
5. If changing plans, label their emotion first: "You're obviously annoyed that I postponed - I'm sorry for the inconvenience"

**Your landlord example IS the model**: "I previously said yes, but this other place with 2 bathrooms is too hard to give up. You're obviously annoyed by this, but I hope you understand."

See patterns.md "Pattern 1: Acknowledging Emotions" and "Pattern 5: Negotiating Terms"

## Salary Discussions

**Stay warm while being clear:**
1. Express genuine enthusiasm: "I'm really excited about this role and the team"
2. Acknowledge market context: "Based on my research for similar roles..."
3. Label potential concern: "You might be thinking this is outside your budget..."
4. Collaborate: "I was expecting £X-Y range - how does that work with what you had in mind?"
5. Multiple variables: "I'm also interested in discussing remote flexibility and start date"

**Tone**: Positive & playful, not demanding. You're excited and want to make it work.

See patterns.md "Salary/Compensation Negotiation"

## Work Requests

**Acknowledge their reality first:**
1. Label their constraint: "I know you're swamped with the Q4 analysis"
2. State what you need: "Could you send me the retention data by Friday?"
3. Make it easy: "If you just point me to where it lives, I can pull it myself"
4. Give them an out: "If Friday doesn't work, what works on your end?"

**Pattern**: [Acknowledge their workload] + [Specific ask] + [Make it easy for them]

See patterns.md "Pattern 2: Making Asks Clear"

## Changing Plans or Backing Out

**Your instincts are perfect here:**

1. Apologize for the impact: "I'm sorry for the late change"
2. Be honest about why: "This other place has 2 bathrooms which is hard to give up"
3. **Label their emotion explicitly**: "You're obviously annoyed by this"
4. Stay human: "I hope you understand"

**Don't**: Disappear, be vague, skip the emotion label, refuse to apologize

**The emotion label is critical** - it shows you're not oblivious and defuses their anger.

See patterns.md "Pattern 3: Changing Plans/Backing Out"

## Saying No (While Preserving Relationship)

**Structure**: [Direct no] + [Brief reason] + [Alternative if easy] + [No excessive apology]

**Example**: "I can't take this on right now - I'm at capacity with current projects. Have you tried asking [person]?"

**If you feel guilty**: Label it preemptively with an accusation audit: "You're probably frustrated that I'm saying no after you asked specifically..."

See patterns.md "Pattern 4: Saying No"
