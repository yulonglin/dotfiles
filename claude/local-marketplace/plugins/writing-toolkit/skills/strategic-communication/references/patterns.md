# Communication Patterns & Examples

## Message Refinement Patterns

### Pattern 1: Acknowledging Emotions + Clear Communication

**Before**: "I'm going with another place."

**After**: "I previously said yes, but this other place with 2 toilets is just too hard to give up. You're obviously annoyed by this, but I hope you understand."

**Principle**: Label their emotion, acknowledge you changed plans, maintain your decision. Being human beats being businesslike.

### Pattern 2: Making Asks Clear (Without Being Demanding)

**Before**: "I'm sorry to bother you, but I was wondering if maybe you might have time to possibly look at this when you get a chance?"

**After**: "I know you're swamped - could you review this by Friday? Let me know if that timeline doesn't work."

**Principle**: Acknowledge their reality, one clear ask with a deadline, make it easy to say no if needed.

### Pattern 3: Changing Plans/Backing Out

**Before**: [Just ghosting or being vague]

**After**: "I'm sorry for the late change - something unexpected came up. You're probably frustrated since you took time off, which I totally get. Is there anything I can do to make this easier on your end?"

**Principle**: Apologize for the inconvenience, label their likely emotion, offer to help. Don't just bail.

### Pattern 4: Saying No While Preserving Relationship

**Before**: "I'm so sorry, I really wish I could help but I have so much on my plate right now and I'm already behind on three other things and I feel terrible about it..."

**After**: "I can't take this on right now - I'm at capacity with current projects. Have you tried asking [other person]?"

**Principle**: Direct no, brief reason, helpful alternative (optional). Don't spiral into guilt.

### Pattern 5: Negotiating Terms Collaboratively

**Before**: "I'd really love to rent your place but I can only stay 3 months. Would you be willing to accept that? I can pay more if needed!"

**After**: "I'm looking to rent from now through early February (about 3.5 months). I saw you mentioned 6 months minimum - how would a shorter-term tenant work for you?"

**Principle**: State your need, acknowledge their preference, ask how to make it work. Let them propose solutions (including price) rather than negotiating against yourself.

### Pattern 6: Following Up Without Being Pushy

**Before**: "Just bumping this to the top of your inbox! No rush but whenever you get a chance would be great!"

**After**: "Following up on the proposal I sent last Tuesday. I need to finalize plans by Friday - can you confirm by then?"

**Principle**: Reference specific previous message, state your deadline/constraint clearly.

## Situation-Specific Templates

### Cold Outreach (Research/Professional)

Template:
```
[Specific connection or context]

[One sentence about what you want and why it's mutually beneficial]

[Easy response option or specific ask]

[Brief closing]
```

Example:
```
Hi [Name],

I saw your work on [specific thing] - particularly interested in your approach to [detail that shows you actually read their work].

I'm working on [your thing] and think there might be interesting overlap with [their interest]. Would you be open to a 20-minute call to explore this?

I'm free [two specific time options]. Let me know if either works or if you'd rather chat async.

Best,
[You]
```

### Research Team Communication

Template:
```
[Context/update if relevant]

[Specific ask or decision point]

[Your recommendation or next steps]
```

Example:
```
The funding deadline is in 5 days. We need to decide whether to accept this 6-month grant or hold out for the longer Alignment Project.

My read: Accept the 6-month funding now since it's confirmed, then reapply for Alignment Project next year if we want to extend. Low risk and we can evaluate midway through.

Does that logic work for you? If there's a consideration I'm missing, let me know by Wednesday.
```

### Salary/Compensation Negotiation

Template:
```
[Express enthusiasm about the role/offer]

[Reference market research or competing offer if you have one]

[State your ask on multiple dimensions]

[Make it easy for them to say yes or counter]
```

Example:
```
Thanks for the offer - I'm excited about the role and the team.

Based on market research for similar roles in London and my experience level, I was expecting compensation in the £X-Y range. Additionally, I'd value flexibility to work remotely 2 days per week.

Would £X salary plus remote flexibility work on your end? Open to discussing the full compensation package.

Looking forward to making this work.
```

### Asking Colleagues for Help/Resources

Template:
```
[What you're trying to accomplish]

[Specific help needed from them]

[What's in it for them or how you'll minimize their effort]
```

Example:
```
I'm pulling together the Q4 analysis for the board meeting next week.

Could you send me the latest user retention data? Specifically need month-over-month numbers for Sept-Oct.

I know you're swamped - if you just point me to where it lives, I can pull it myself.
```

## Red Flags in Your Drafts

Watch for these patterns that weaken messages:

### Over-hedging
- "I think maybe..."
- "Kind of wondering if..."
- "Possibly could you..."

**Fix**: Remove hedging words. Make declarative statements.

### Excessive Apology (The Wrong Kind)
- "Sorry to bother you" (for just sending an email)
- "Sorry for existing" vibes
- Apologizing for having reasonable needs

**Fix**: Save apologies for when your actions actually inconvenience someone. Don't apologize for taking up space.

**But DO apologize when:**
- You changed plans: "Sorry for the late change"
- You made a mistake: "My bad, I misunderstood"  
- You're genuinely inconveniencing them: "Sorry to ask last minute"

### Vague Asks
- "When you get a chance..."
- "Whenever works for you..."
- "No rush but..."

**Fix**: Specific deadline or timeframe. If genuinely flexible, say "No hard deadline, but aiming for end of week."

### Negotiating Against Yourself
- Offering solutions before hearing objections
- Immediately sweetening deals unprompted
- "I can pay more" before they ask

**Fix**: State your position, ask how it could work for them, wait for their response.

### Missing Emotion Acknowledgment
- Ignoring obvious tension or inconvenience
- Being all business when the situation is clearly emotional
- Not acknowledging when you've changed plans or disappointed them

**Fix**: Name the emotion. "You're probably frustrated..." / "I imagine this is annoying..." / "You're obviously concerned about..."

### Empty Pleasantries
- "Hope this email finds you well"
- "I hope you're having a great day"
- "I trust you are doing wonderfully"

**Fix**: Skip or use genuine specific reference ("Congrats on the paper launch last week").

## Context-Aware Tone Calibration

### Formal Professional (Salary, Legal, Senior Stakeholders)
- Full sentences, proper grammar
- "Dear [Name]" / "Best regards"
- More structured paragraphs
- Reference specific policies/procedures where relevant

### Casual Professional (Team Chat, Slack, Colleagues)
- Shorter messages okay
- "Hi [Name]" / "Thanks!"
- Bullet points and fragments acceptable
- Emoji fine if they use them

### Urgent/High-Stakes (Deadlines, Conflicts, Critical Decisions)
- Lead with the key information
- Very specific about what you need and when
- Skip pleasantries entirely
- Make response options crystal clear

### Relationship-Building (Networking, Long-term Collaborators)
- More context about your thinking
- Show genuine interest in their work
- Build in reciprocity
- Less transactional framing
