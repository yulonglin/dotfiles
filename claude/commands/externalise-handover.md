# Externalise / Handover tasks

Externalise important parts of the current conversation into an .md file to hand over to another colleague or agent. In particular, focus on:
- tasks to do next
- what's been accomplished (exact commands run, inputs/args, outputs including file paths)
- bugs
- key areas of uncertainties
- user instructions and clarifications, touched up to be clearer
