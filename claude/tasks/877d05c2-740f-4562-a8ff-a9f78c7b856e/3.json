  "description": "Filter existing prompted sandbagger traces to identify:\n- Explicit: Mentions strategy, bias, systematic approach\n- Implicit: No strategy leakage but still sandbagging\n\nUse combination of:\n1. Keyword matching (current)\n2. LLM judge for SAS/suspicious scoring (Claude 3.5 Haiku or similar)\n3. Count how many implicit traces remain after strict filtering\n\nDeliverable: Filtered dataset splits, statistics on explicit vs implicit volumes",
