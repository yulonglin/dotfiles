Layer 2: C3 (catches sophisticated cases that pass TM)\n\nExperiments:\n- Combined ROC curve showing ensemble performance\n- Analyze cases where TM fails but C3 succeeds\n- Compute optimal threshold for TM first-pass filter\n- Show improvement over either method alone\n\nThis is the reframed narrative for ICML.",
