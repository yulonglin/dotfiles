  "description": "Run Anthropic trusted monitor on existing password-locked model outputs to determine if they evade monitoring. This is THE critical experiment that determines the entire narrative.\n\nSteps:\n1. Locate existing password-locked model .eval files\n2. Run trusted monitor classifier (Anthropic version)\n3. Compare TM suspicion scores vs C3 consistency scores\n4. Determine if we have \"Monitor fails, C3 works\" scenario\n\n**This determines Plan A viability** - must complete before other experiments.\n\nExpected outcome: CSV with TM scores, comparison analysis",
