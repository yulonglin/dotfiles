  "description": "Design and test improved sandbagging prompts that:\n1. Provide realistic, strong incentives (check ~/writing/brainstorming/ideas/sandbagging-incentives/SYNTHESIS.md)\n2. Include scratchpad for reasoning models (gpt-5-nano with reasoning_effort: low)\n3. Emphasize stealth and avoiding detection\n4. Test with LLM SAS judge to ensure no strategy leakage\n\nApproach:\n- Start from selected prompts in specs/icml-baseline-expts/\n- Improve borderline ones that had strategy leaks\n- Make non-sandbagging prompts more aggressive\n- Test on small samples (N=10) before full runs",
