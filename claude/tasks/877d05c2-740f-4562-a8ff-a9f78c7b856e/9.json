Run C3 on honest/benign models with same paraphrases (baseline natural variance)\n2. Stratify by correctness: Compare consistency on correct vs incorrect honest answers\n3. Compute effect sizes (Cohen's d) to show sandbagging drop is significant\n4. Control for model capability differences\n\nFocus on GPQA and MATH.",
