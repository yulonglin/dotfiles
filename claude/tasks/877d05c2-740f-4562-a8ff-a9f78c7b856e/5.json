  "description": "Create LLM judge to detect suspicious/scheming behavior for PROMPT SELECTION PIPELINE (not for detection experiments).\n\nThis will make the prompt selection pipeline stricter by using LLM-based SAS scoring instead of just keyword matching.\n\nRequirements:\n1. Use weak model (Claude 3.5 Haiku) for efficiency\n2. Ask follow-up questions to probe for inconsistencies\n3. Score on SAS/suspicious scale (0-10 or 1-100)\n4. Integrate into prompt_selection/filters.py\n\nLower priority - focus on tasks #2 and #4 first.",
