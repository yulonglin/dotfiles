## Example Interaction

**User:** "I need to prepare slides for my advisor meeting tomorrow. We're discussing my experiments on deception detection."

**Skill Response:**
1. Ask about context:
   - What did you discuss last meeting?
   - What experiments did you run?
   - Did they succeed or fail?
   - What decision needs to be made?

2. Propose structure:
   - Slide 1: Summary (last meeting → what you tried → success/failure → decision needed)
   - Slide 2: Agenda with time allocation
   - Slide 3-4: Key results (1 plot per slide, clear comparisons)
   - Slide 5: Next steps proposal
   - Appendix: Full prompts, detailed methods

3. Review visualizations:
   - Are comparisons clear?
   - Are error bars shown?
   - Are baselines included?
   - Is statistical significance indicated?
   - Are prompts included (for LLM experiments)?

4. Suggest prioritization:
   - What's most important to discuss?
   - What can be skipped if time is short?
   - What needs decision vs. FYI?
