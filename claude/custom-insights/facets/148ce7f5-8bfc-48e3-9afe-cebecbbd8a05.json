  "brief_summary": "Following up on a previous finding, the user asked Claude to verify if a known lie detector confound affected all 10 variants. Claude designed and executed a systematic experiment, running each detector on both same-model and mixed-model data. It then wrote a script to analyze the 20 resulting data files, confirming that 9/10 detectors were indeed confounded, and updated the project's documentation and slides with these definitive results.",
