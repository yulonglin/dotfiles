  "friction_detail": "Initial context loss about a 'pie chart' required user to re-explain. A data loading issue occurred where an old file was used instead of the new one, requiring debugging. A LaTeX compilation error also occurred.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully debugging a complex data loading issue where an old data file was taking precedence over a new one, and then correctly regenerating all figures and updating the paper.",
  "brief_summary": "The user initiated a complex update session starting with a git merge that had conflicts, which Claude resolved. The main task was to update figures and data, including creating new 'bar+pie' charts, separating adversarial prompts, and fixing a bug where an old data file was being used. The session concluded with numerous text corrections in the paper to reflect the new data.",
