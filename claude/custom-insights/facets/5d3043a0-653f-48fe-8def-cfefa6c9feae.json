  "friction_detail": "Initial PDF reading attempts failed, requiring fallback to web search and local file access via sub-agents. The agent also had to be explicitly told to use sub-agents to handle large files.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully synthesized two distinct but complementary academic writing styles (empirical vs. conceptual) into a single, structured, actionable style guide.",
  "brief_summary": "User wanted to use two papers as style guides. After initial failures reading the PDFs, Claude used sub-agents to analyze them. It extracted key patterns for titles, abstracts, and rhetoric, created a comprehensive `paper-writing-style-guide.md`, and updated the `paper-writer` agent to use it.",
