  "friction_detail": "The initial fix to the plotting script seemed to fail, as the figure remained unchanged. This was due to the file being modified externally, so Claude had to re-analyze the file and apply the fix again to the new line numbers.",
  "primary_success": "Pinpointed the exact lines of code in a Python script that were causing incorrect data visualization in a report figure (dividing a pre-calculated rate by n) and corrected it.",
  "brief_summary": "User reported a data inconsistency in a research report figure. Claude identified that the text and figure values didn't match, diagnosed the bug in the Python plotting script, and fixed the calculation. After an initial failed attempt to update the figure, Claude re-applied the fix and successfully recompiled the report with the corrected plot.",
