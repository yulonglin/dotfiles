  "primary_success": "Providing a very clear, structured comparison between the two detection methods (rule-based vs. LLM-as-judge) and then following up with concrete prompt/response examples for each judge, which clarified the abstract concepts.",
  "brief_summary": "The user asked for an explanation of the judge configurations and the refusal detector in their sandbagging detection pipeline. Claude provided a detailed breakdown of both systems, comparing the rule-based detector with the LLM-as-judge approach, and then gave concrete examples of prompts and responses for each judge.",
