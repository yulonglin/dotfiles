  "friction_detail": "Claude initially recommended archiving all '*-test.yaml' files, misinterpreting them as debugging artifacts instead of essential test-set evaluation configs. The user had to clarify their purpose to prevent them from being archived.",
  "primary_success": "Efficiently categorizing over 200 configuration files and collaboratively creating a precise archival plan with the user, preventing the accidental deletion of critical test-set configs.",
  "brief_summary": "The user wanted to archive old experiment configs before a fresh ICML run. Claude analyzed 210 files, proposing an archival plan that was iteratively refined with the user to ensure critical configs (like test-set evaluations and recent ablations) were preserved. Ultimately, 71 outdated configs were successfully archived.",
