  "friction_detail": "Claude incorrectly claimed Apollo Research uses a 'no explicit admissions' criterion and had to correct itself after being challenged by the user.",
  "primary_success": "Helping the user develop a defensible research methodology by reframing the contribution as a 'capability-detectability frontier' and grounding filter thresholds in literature or explicit design choices.",
  "brief_summary": "The user and Claude discussed and refined a prompt selection pipeline. Claude initially made an incorrect claim about a source but corrected itself when challenged. The session evolved into a productive discussion on making the research methodology defensible, leading to the idea of framing the work as a 'capability-detectability frontier' and updating the project spec and paper with a more robust rationale.",
