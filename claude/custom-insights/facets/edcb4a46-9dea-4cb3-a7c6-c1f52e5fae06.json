  "friction_detail": "The internal 'Plan agent' and 'Codex' agent both crashed during the design phase. However, Claude was able to recover, use the partial research results from the failed agents, and still produce a high-quality final plan.",
  "primary_success": "Managed a complex, research-heavy design process, synthesizing findings from multiple sources (including from failed sub-agents) and incorporating critiques to produce a robust, incremental plan for a new developer tool.",
  "brief_summary": "The user wanted to create a tool to 'humanize' AI writing. Claude led a research and design process, synthesizing findings from web searches and existing code. Despite its sub-agents crashing, it recovered, incorporated critiques, and produced a robust plan for an MVP `humanizer` agent with an incremental rollout strategy.",
