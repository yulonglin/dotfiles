  "friction_detail": "Initial analysis was flawed due to incorrect model pairing (same-model vs cross-model), using a non-optimal lie detector classifier, and selecting suboptimal paraphrase strategies. This required multiple user corrections and reruns to get the correct, comparable results.",
  "primary_success": "Systematically debugging the surprising results to uncover the critical 'model pairing confound', which was the key insight that C3's effectiveness was inflated by detecting model differences (gpt-5 vs gpt-4.1) rather than just sandbagging behavior.",
  "brief_summary": "The user tasked the agent with generating results for a research update on 'good liar' sandbagging prompts. Through an iterative process of analysis, user feedback, and debugging, the agent uncovered a critical methodological confound related to model pairing. The agent corrected its analysis, produced accurate comparison tables for multiple detection methods (Lie Detector, C3), and synthesized the final narrative for the research update.",
