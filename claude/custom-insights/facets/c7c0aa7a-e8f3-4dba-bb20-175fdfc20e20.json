  "friction_detail": "Claude initially misunderstood how to pass data to the Gemini CLI, attempting to use `@file` which was sandboxed, and had to be corrected to use stdin. There was also a minor issue with `mtime` logic for caching that was identified and corrected.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully implemented the entire analytics pipeline script (~400 lines) including data extraction, batching logic for Gemini CLI, caching, and report generation based on a detailed plan.",
  "brief_summary": "The user provided a detailed plan to build a custom usage analytics script to overcome the limitations of the built-in /insights command. Claude implemented the Python script, prompt files, and an optional skill wrapper, including debugging the interaction with the Gemini CLI. The session concluded with the pipeline being verified and ready for the user to customize the analysis prompts.",
