  "friction_detail": "Initial prompts were instructed, not incentive-based, requiring a pivot. The agent also misunderstood the need for same-model comparison initially and encountered a macOS sandbox resource limit error.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully navigated a complex, multi-pivot research task, implementing three different sandbagging paradigms (instructed, incentive, discovered) and correctly identifying the 'discovered incentive' (Meinke-style) as the most effective method.",
  "brief_summary": "User initiated a research task to create stealthy sandbagging prompts. The session involved multiple iterations and pivots, moving from 'instructed' to 'incentive-based' to 'discovered' prompts based on user feedback and experimental results. Despite several debugging challenges (config errors, sandbox limits, incorrect model comparisons), the agent successfully identified an effective sandbagging technique (Meinke-style prefill) and set up a plan for the next phase of research on detection methods.",
