  "friction_detail": "The gpt-5-nano runs consistently failed due to a 300s timeout. This required debugging, where it was discovered the runner was not passing the `reasoning_effort: minimal` parameter, causing gpt-5-nano to be too slow. The agent had to implement a code fix in the runner to solve this.",
  "primary_success": "Diagnosing and fixing the `reasoning_effort` bug in the prompt selection runner that was causing all gpt-5-nano evaluations to time out. This unblocked the entire experiment and allowed for the successful comparison between the two models.",
  "brief_summary": "The user initiated a large-scale rerun of the prompt selection pipeline for two models and two datasets. The gpt-5-nano runs repeatedly failed due to timeouts, which the agent diagnosed as a bug in the runner script not correctly setting `reasoning_effort: minimal`. After implementing a code fix, all four pipelines were run to completion, and the agent produced a detailed comparison of the results, highlighting that the more advanced gpt-5-nano model was significantly more resistant to most sandbagging prompts.",
