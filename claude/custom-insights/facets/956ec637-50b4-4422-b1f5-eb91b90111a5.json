  "primary_success": "Accurately diagnosed the root cause of the broken Streamlit dashboard (a Python import path issue) and provided a concise, correct fix. It then synthesized external feedback into a new, highly-prioritized plan focusing on high-value tasks.",
  "brief_summary": "The user asked for a status update and next steps. Claude summarized the project's state, correctly identified a critical Streamlit import error as the main blocker, and proposed a fix. The session then pivoted to a strategic planning phase, where Claude incorporated hypothetical judge feedback to create a revised, high-impact plan that prioritized fixing the demo, finding data insights, and adding human validation over lower-value infrastructure work.",
