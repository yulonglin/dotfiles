  "friction_detail": "The primary issue was the discovery of a major methodological confound in the original experiment plan, where the lie detector was detecting model identity instead of sandbagging. Other friction included API timeouts during data processing, a script that produced truncated output requiring a workaround, and a misunderstanding of how a script's `--limit` flag worked.",
  "primary_success": "Identifying a critical methodological confound in the user's experiment plan where the lie detector was detecting model identity instead of sandbagging. Claude proposed a fix by generating proper baseline data, executed the corrected analysis, and produced a robust and surprising new finding, which was then compiled into a full research update and presentation slides.",
  "brief_summary": "The session began with a plan to re-run sandbagging detection experiments. Claude quickly identified a critical confound: the 'lie detector' was simply detecting model identity, not sandbagging behavior. After getting user approval, Claude generated new 'proper baseline' data, re-ran all analyses, and produced corrected results revealing that the C3 method was genuinely effective while the lie detector was not. The session concluded with Claude generating a full research update and presentation slides reflecting these corrected findings.",
