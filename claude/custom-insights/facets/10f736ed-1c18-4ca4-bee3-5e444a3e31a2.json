  "brief_summary": "The user described three desired improvements for their research workflow: date helpers, a research-focused interview tool, and a new plotting style. Claude engaged in a detailed design discussion, clarifying requirements and proposing robust solutions like a separate research interview skill and a two-phase validation process to prevent errors, culminating in a detailed implementation plan.",
