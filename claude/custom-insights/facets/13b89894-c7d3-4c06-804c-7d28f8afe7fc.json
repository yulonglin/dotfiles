  "friction_detail": "The agent faced several environment setup issues during testing, including creating a virtual environment, resolving a Python version incompatibility, and fixing an API key loading order issue with dotenv. It solved each of these systematically.",
  "primary_success": "Systematically debugged and resolved multiple environment and configuration issues (venv, Python version, API key loading) to get the test running, and correctly verified the partial success of its implementation from the transcript of a failing test run.",
  "brief_summary": "The agent implemented the `lookup_project` tool. When asked to test it, the agent systematically debugged and fixed several environment issues (venv, Python version, API key loading). It then correctly verified from the test transcript that its part of the implementation was working, even though the overall test failed as expected.",
