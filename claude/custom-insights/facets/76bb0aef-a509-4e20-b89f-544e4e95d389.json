  "friction_detail": "Claude repeatedly failed to stage deleted files correctly, misunderstanding how `git add` and `git add -u` work for deletions and renames. The user had to provide the correct git knowledge to resolve the issue.",
  "primary_success": "Claude correctly identified that the changes should be split into multiple logical commits.",
  "brief_summary": "The user asked Claude to commit and push changes. Claude struggled with staging renamed/deleted files, leading to multiple tool failures and a discussion where the user corrected Claude's misunderstanding of `git add -u`. Although the commits were eventually made, the session was dominated by debugging Claude's incorrect git workflow.",
