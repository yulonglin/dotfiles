  "primary_success": "Correctly determined the call order, showing that the cache check happens at a higher layer than the batch vs. real-time decision, and provided a clear architectural diagram of the call flow.",
  "brief_summary": "The user asked if batch API calls use the local cache. The agent investigated the codebase and the underlying Inspect AI library, determining that the cache check occurs before the request is routed to the batcher. The agent concluded that batch calls do hit the cache and provided a clear call flow diagram.",
