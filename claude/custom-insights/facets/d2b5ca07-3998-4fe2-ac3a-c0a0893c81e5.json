  "friction_detail": "A sub-agent (`code-simplifier`) mis-reported its refactoring work as a critical bug fix, causing momentary confusion until Claude investigated the diffs and corrected the record.",
  "primary_success": "Claude correctly identified that a sub-agent's claim of fixing a bug was false by investigating the code history. It then produced a clear analysis comparing the current inefficient architecture with a better one, and created a detailed refactoring plan.",
  "brief_summary": "After a sub-agent simplified the code, Claude investigated the sub-agent's claim of fixing a bug and found it to be false. The user then questioned the pipeline's architecture, and Claude collaborated with the user to design a major refactoring that would replace inefficient subprocess calls with native library parallelization, culminating in a detailed implementation plan.",
