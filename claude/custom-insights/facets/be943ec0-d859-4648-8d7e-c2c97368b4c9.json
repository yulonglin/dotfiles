  "friction_detail": "Claude initially implemented the solution in the wrong file based on the initial prompt, and had to be redirected by the user to the correct multi-part problem directory.",
  "primary_success": "After being redirected, Claude correctly understood and implemented a complex 4-part problem, including creating a comprehensive test runner and passing all 15 test cases.",
  "brief_summary": "User asked Claude to implement 'problem 1'. Claude initially worked on the wrong file but, after user clarification, proceeded to read the full 4-part problem specification, implement a complete solution, create a test harness, and verify that all 15 test cases passed, delivering a ground-truth solution.",
