It clearly explained the technical differences and guided the user to build and serve a production version to verify the performance improvement.",
  "brief_summary": "The user reported slow page loading on their website. Claude investigated the site's architecture, correctly diagnosing that the user was experiencing the slowness inherent to Gatsby's development server. Claude explained the reasons (e.g., no optimization, on-the-fly compilation) and guided the user through creating and running a production build, which resolved the issue.",
