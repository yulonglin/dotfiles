  "brief_summary": "The user asked to verify dataset sizes between the codebase and a research paper. The agent found that the MATH Level 5 dataset was underreported in the paper by over 3x (724 vs 2,304 samples). After the user confirmed, the agent correctly navigated to the paper's separate, symlinked git repository to commit and push the fix.",
