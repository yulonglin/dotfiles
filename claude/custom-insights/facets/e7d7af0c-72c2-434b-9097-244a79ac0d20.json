  "friction_detail": "Deployment script initially failed due to sandbox 'operation not permitted' errors, requiring a workaround. Also, the initial high-contrast color implementation used a non-existent API before being corrected.",
  "primary_success": "Claude correctly diagnosed that the pdb++ color configuration was using a non-existent API, researched the correct API, and implemented a robust, high-contrast color scheme using proper Pygments and ANSI code attributes.",
  "brief_summary": "The user and Claude iteratively improved the `pdb++` configuration. First, Claude documented the existing deployment logic. Then, responding to user feedback, it fixed the high-contrast colors by correcting the API usage. Finally, it implemented a terminal background auto-detection mechanism with a safe fallback, handling some plan-mode confusion along the way.",
