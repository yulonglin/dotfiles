  "friction_detail": "The initial analysis compared mixed-model and same-model results that used different sets of sandbagging prompts (aggressive vs. stealth), which was a confound. Claude had to identify this and find a fair comparison dataset using the same prompts across settings.",
  "primary_success": "Quantified the lie detector confound, showing that detection collapses from ~95% recall (mixed-model) to ~35% (same-model). It also identified and corrected for a second confound (different prompts used across experiments), enabling a fair comparison. The findings were then documented and added to a presentation.",
  "brief_summary": "User asked to investigate the lie detector confound. Claude found existing analysis and then performed a new analysis for the gpt-4.1-nano model. After discovering and correcting for a prompt-based confound in the experiments, Claude produced a comprehensive table showing that lie detector performance collapses in same-model settings, confirming the confound is severe. The findings were then added to a presentation and a new documentation file.",
