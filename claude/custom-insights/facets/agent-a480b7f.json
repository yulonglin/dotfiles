  "brief_summary": "The user asked for performance metrics of a lie detector on V4.1 stealth prompts. Claude systematically searched for and found relevant CSV results, analysis scripts, and design documents. It then aggregated the data into a clear summary table, proving that the detector's AUROC collapsed to near-random levels (0.43-0.50) on the V4.1 prompts, thus fully achieving the user's research goal.",
