  "friction_detail": "Sub-agents failed multiple times due to connection errors or getting stuck in plan mode, requiring Claude to monitor, diagnose, and relaunch them. There was minor confusion about skill naming conventions at the end.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully orchestrating the entire complex workflow: implementing a multi-batch plan with parallel agents, coordinating a multi-agent code review, synthesizing the feedback, and then systematically implementing all critical bug fixes found by the reviewers.",
  "brief_summary": "Following a detailed, externally-critiqued plan, Claude orchestrated a major overhaul of an AI brainstorming pipeline. It managed parallel sub-agents to refactor the code and add new features like multi-step synthesis. After implementation, it coordinated a multi-agent code review, synthesized the resulting bug reports, and then systematically fixed all critical issues before updating documentation and committing the work.",
