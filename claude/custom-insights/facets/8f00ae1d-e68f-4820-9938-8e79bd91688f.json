  "friction_detail": "Claude initially focused on the missing `terminal-notifier` dependency as the root cause, before correctly identifying that the custom hook itself was redundant due to a native 'Notifications: Auto' setting in Claude Code.",
  "primary_success": "Correctly diagnosing that the user's custom notification hook was redundant because of a native 'Auto' setting in the tool, and then cleanly removing the unnecessary configuration.",
  "brief_summary": "The user reported unwanted Script Editor pop-ups from notifications. Claude investigated the hooks, initially suspecting a missing dependency (`terminal-notifier`), but then correctly identified a native 'Notifications: Auto' setting that made the custom hook redundant. Claude removed the hook from the settings and archived the script file, resolving the issue.",
