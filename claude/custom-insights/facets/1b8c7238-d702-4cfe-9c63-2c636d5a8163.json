  "friction_detail": "The browser extension disconnected mid-task, requiring reconnection and state recovery. Later, an attempt to switch to a more reliable `curl`-based approach failed due to sandbox network restrictions. Claude also initially only scraped question descriptions, misunderstanding that the full set of JSON test cases for all 16 questions was also required.",
  "primary_success": "Systematically discovering the 4x4 progressive structure of the coding challenges and successfully scraping all 16 question descriptions into organized README files despite a browser tool disconnection.",
  "brief_summary": "The user tasked Claude with scraping 16 coding questions and their test cases. Claude explored the site, discovered the 4x4 structure, and began scraping with browser automation. After overcoming a browser disconnection and discovering `curl` was not a viable alternative, it successfully scraped all 16 question descriptions into README files, but realized it had not yet extracted the full JSON test cases, ending the session with a plan to do so.",
