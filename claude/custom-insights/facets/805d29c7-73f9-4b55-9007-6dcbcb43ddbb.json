  "brief_summary": "The user asked if the Inspect AI framework could cache expensive scoring and sandbox results. Claude investigated the documentation, confirmed that only model outputs are cached, and explained the recommended two-phase 'eval --no-score' then 'score' workflow as a solution. This fully answered the user's question and related it to their specific research context.",
