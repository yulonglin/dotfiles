  "brief_summary": "The user wanted to explore combining Trusted Monitor and C3 classifier signals. The agent brainstormed several no-training ensemble and cascade methods, recommended a path forward focusing on score fusion, and summarized the options into a clear research strategy, distinguishing between simple TM score aggregation and a more novel 'TM consistency' approach.",
