  "primary_success": "Claude engaged in a sophisticated, collaborative discussion about statistical metrics for deception detection, acting as a research peer to refine the user's initial intuition and proposing several concrete technical approaches.",
  "brief_summary": "The user brainstormed a new detection metric idea ('max of max distance'). Claude engaged in a deep, iterative discussion about the statistical intuitions behind it, considering counterarguments (bimodality in benign models) and proposing various alternative technical implementations (kurtosis, dip test). The session concluded with documenting the refined metric idea in the project's specifications.",
