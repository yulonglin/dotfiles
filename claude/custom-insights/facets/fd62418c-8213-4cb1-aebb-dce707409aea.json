  "friction_detail": "Initially provided incorrect syntax for a path-based `Read` permission, but quickly self-corrected after.",
  "primary_success": "Accurately diagnosing and explaining the nuances of Claude Code's permission system (prefix-based matching for Bash, path globs for Read) and applying multiple fixes to solve the user's issues.",
  "brief_summary": "The user asked why several shell commands were not auto-approved. Claude diagnosed issues with commands involving pipes and commands that didn't match simple prefixes. It added `sleep` and `nohup` to the allowed commands, created a path-based rule for reading task outputs, and improved the /run-experiment skill to always run in the background.",
