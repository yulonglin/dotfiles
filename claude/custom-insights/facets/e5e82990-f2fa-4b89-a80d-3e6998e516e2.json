  "friction_detail": "Internal agents used for research and critique failed during the process, but Claude was able to recover and synthesize their partial results into the final plan.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully steered a complex, evolving design discussion, researching what practitioners use and pivoting from a complex custom solution to a simpler, more pragmatic plan that met all the user's constraints (cost, transparency, low noise).",
  "brief_summary": "Continuing a previous conversation, this session finalized a plan for a memory system. It evolved from a complex custom build to a pragmatic approach based on practitioner workflows, using `claude-mem`, per-project task migration, and stale-doc detection to address the user's core pain points around organization and stale documentation.",
