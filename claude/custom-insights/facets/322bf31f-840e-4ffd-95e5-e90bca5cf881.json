  "friction_detail": "The initial script run timed out. A significant bug was later discovered in the SEM calculation logic where epoch data was overwritten instead of averaged, requiring a script fix. There were also path inconsistencies in cache files.",
  "primary_success": "Identified and fixed a subtle but critical bug in the statistical analysis script where results from multiple epochs were being overwritten instead of averaged, leading to incorrect SEM calculations.",
  "brief_summary": "The user ran a sandbagging prompt selection pipeline that initially failed due to a timeout. The agent helped debug the failure, re-run the pipeline, and then investigated result discrepancies. This led to discovering and fixing a critical bug in the SEM calculation script, validating the statistical methodology, and successfully generating the final documentation.",
