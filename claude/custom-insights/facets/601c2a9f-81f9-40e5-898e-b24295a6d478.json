  "brief_summary": "The user inquired about adding 'AUROC<0.05' as a metric. Claude clarified the statistical confusion, explaining pAUROC and TPR @ 5% FPR. By checking existing project files, Claude found that the established convention was to use AUROC and Recall @ 5% FPR, and recommended sticking with that for consistency.",
