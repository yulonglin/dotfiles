  "friction_detail": "The figure generation script initially displayed an incorrect result for the C\u00b3 method (showing 0% instead of 19%) due to a bug in parsing bolded markdown text from the results file.",
  "primary_success": "Claude identified that new data fundamentally changed the paper's narrative, proposed new figures to support this new story, and implemented them, while also debugging a tricky markdown parsing bug in the process.",
  "brief_summary": "The user provided new results for a sandbagging setup. Claude analyzed them, noted they changed the narrative from 'all methods fail' to 'C\u00b3 shows a weak signal,' and then generated new figures and updated the paper text to reflect this. During the process, Claude debugged a markdown parsing issue that caused a figure to display incorrect data, ensuring the final output was accurate.",
