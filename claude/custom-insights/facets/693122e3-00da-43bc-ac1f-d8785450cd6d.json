  "friction_detail": "The agent initially proposed fixing the path by hardcoding it or using an environment variable, both of which the user rejected. This led to a more robust discussion and the eventual adoption of the superior symlinking strategy.",
  "primary_success": "Guiding the user towards the best-practice solution (symlinking) by clearly presenting the pros and cons of different approaches, and then implementing it cleanly in the deployment script.",
  "brief_summary": "The user reported a vim error caused by an invalid path in their `.vimrc`. After a discussion where the agent proposed several fixes, the user and agent agreed that symlinking `~/.vimrc` to the file in the dotfiles repository was the most robust solution. The agent updated the `deploy.sh` script to create this symlink instead of sourcing the file, and then committed the change.",
