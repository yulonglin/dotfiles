  "primary_success": "Claude orchestrated a powerful parallel analysis by spawning six specialized subagents to simultaneously audit and revise a research paper for different issues (model consistency, experiment inventory, writing style, abstract structure, method/experiment separation, and baseline framing).",
  "brief_summary": "The user initiated a major paper review by pointing Claude to a spec file. Claude analyzed the tasks, identified what it could automate, and launched six parallel subagents to handle different aspects: auditing model settings, inventorying experiments, improving writing, restructuring the abstract, separating methods from experiments, and reframing a baseline. The session paused after all agents completed, having produced detailed reports and edits, awaiting user input for integration.",
