  "friction_detail": "The assistant initially provided incorrect commands for building and previewing the slides, misunderstanding the distinction between Bun's native bundler and Slidev's commands. It took several attempts to debug the process and arrive at the correct workflow using `slidev build` and a separate static server (`bunx serve dist`).",
  "primary_success": "Successfully debugged a third-party toolchain issue (Slidev + Bun), identified the correct sequence of commands for production builds, and encapsulated them in convenient npm scripts in `package.json`.",
  "brief_summary": "The user wanted the correct command to present optimized Slidev slides. The assistant initially provided incorrect commands but then systematically debugged the toolchain, discovering that `slidev build` creates a static site that needs to be served separately. The final solution involved creating `build` and `present` scripts in `package.json` to automate the correct workflow.",
