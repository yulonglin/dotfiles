  "brief_summary": "The user asked for previous analysis on lie detector signals. Claude explored the codebase and found multiple analysis scripts, documentation, and the raw probe questions. It created a comprehensive summary, highlighting that the primary signal is direct model confessions, and explained a key confound related to different models' baseline 'Yes' rates.",
