  "brief_summary": "The user requested an update to a figure in the paper to include a new data series (an adversarially-trained lie detector). Claude located the relevant figure generation code, incorporated the new data from a separate results file, modified the plotting script to add the new series with a distinct color, updated the figure caption in the LaTeX source, and regenerated the figure.",
