  "brief_summary": "The user proposed improving the Trusted Monitor (TM) baseline by aggregating scores across paraphrases. The agent explored the codebase, found that most infrastructure already existed, and designed a focused plan to add the missing pre-aggregation step. The plan was iteratively refined to ensure a rigorous experimental design for an ICML paper submission.",
