  "primary_success": "The initial automated review that generated a comprehensive and categorized list of issues in the experiment specs. This structured output kickstarted the entire productive session.",
  "brief_summary": "The user asked Claude to review ICML experiment specs. Claude generated a detailed report of issues, which the user then clarified and provided corrections for. Based on this dialogue, Claude created and executed a 10-point plan to fix numerous documentation inconsistencies across multiple files, finally committing and pushing the changes.",
