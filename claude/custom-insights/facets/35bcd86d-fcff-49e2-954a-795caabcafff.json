  "brief_summary": "The user questioned the origin of 'Lab Safety' requirements mentioned in their report. Claude investigated the codebase, found a discrepancy in name and count (15 'Commitments' vs 18 'Standards'), and discovered the true source (Anthropic/OpenAI RSPs) documented in the Streamlit UI code. The session concluded after confirming the report had already been corrected in a previous session.",
