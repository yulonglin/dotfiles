  "friction_detail": "The project specifications were inconsistent, with different files recommending different, conflicting pre-trained classifiers. Claude had to investigate multiple documents to find the single source of truth.",
  "primary_success": "Correctly resolving a significant inconsistency in the project's specifications by investigating multiple documents (individual specs, method specs, model registry) to determine the correct pre-trained classifiers to use.",
  "brief_summary": "The user wanted to create a set of 12 lie detector experiment configs. Claude navigated conflicting and outdated specifications, correctly identifying the authoritative model registry to use for pre-trained classifiers. It then systematically created and validated all 12 configuration files, standardizing the experimental setup.",
