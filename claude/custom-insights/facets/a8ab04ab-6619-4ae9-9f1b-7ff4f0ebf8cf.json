  "friction_detail": "Agent initially connected UK AISI's finding of 10pp improvement in benign models to the C\u00b3 detection method, but then self-corrected that the finding was about training-based elicitation and less relevant.",
  "primary_success": "Conducting a comprehensive literature review across multiple papers to find that only one paper (UK AISI) had an explicit numerical threshold (10pp), providing a strong, citable justification for the user's own choice of threshold.",
  "brief_summary": "The user wanted to justify the 15pp accuracy drop threshold used in their paper. The agent conducted a literature review of several relevant papers, finding that the UK AISI paper was the only one with an explicit threshold (10pp). This allowed the agent to propose a more principled justification for the user's paper, framing their 15pp threshold as a conservative choice relative to the literature.",
