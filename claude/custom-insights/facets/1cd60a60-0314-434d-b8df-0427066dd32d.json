  "brief_summary": "User asked to locate lie detector model files. The agent found them in an unexpected directory, diagnosed the framework's file resolution logic, and copied the missing files to the correct local directory. It then investigated the loading mechanism to confirm exact model matching is used, and finally force-added and committed the small binary files per user request.",
