  "primary_success": "The agent not only found the prompts and results but also uncovered the critical insight from the experiment: that an explicit reasoning step in the prompt was the key to making the in-context scheming behavior manifest, which led to the successful detection.",
  "brief_summary": "The user asked for a full report on the 'Apollo in-context scheming' experiments. The agent located all relevant configs, prompts, and logs, synthesizing a comprehensive summary. It uncovered the key finding that scheming was only triggered when an explicit reasoning step was added to the prompt, and that the C\u00b3 detection method achieved near-perfect results (99.5% recall at k=5) in this scenario.",
