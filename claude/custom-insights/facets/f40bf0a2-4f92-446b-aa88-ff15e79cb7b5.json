  "primary_success": "Correctly diagnosing that the 'low' baseline accuracy was not a bug but a valid result of a rigorous internal evaluation methodology (shuffling, strict formats) and clearly explaining the reasons for the discrepancy with public leaderboard scores.",
  "brief_summary": "The user questioned a low baseline accuracy score for the GPQA dataset. Claude investigated the evaluation files and methodology, determining the score was correct and not a bug. It explained that the discrepancy with public benchmarks was due to stricter internal evaluation criteria like choice shuffling and prompt formatting, confirming the validity of the baseline for the project's relative comparisons.",
