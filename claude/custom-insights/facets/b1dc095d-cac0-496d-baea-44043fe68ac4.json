  "friction_detail": "Initial research phase overlooked existing implementations in the codebase. The implementation of the new interrogation agent had a critical bug where conversation state was not isolated between samples, requiring a significant refactor to fix.",
  "primary_success": "Autonomously conducted a literature review, documented the findings, created an implementation plan for a new 'multi-turn interrogation' feature, implemented the complex multi-agent system, and debugged multiple issues to deliver a working end-to-end pipeline.",
  "brief_summary": "The user kicked off a research task to find new detection baselines. Claude surveyed several papers, documented the findings, and, upon user request, implemented a 'multi-turn interrogation' agent based on Apollo Research's work. The implementation was complex, involving debugging state isolation bugs and tool-calling issues, but ultimately resulted in a complete, working feature.",
