  "brief_summary": "Continuing from the previous session's discovery that the main experiment mode lacked variance reporting, the user and agent engaged specialist sub-agents (data-analyst, research-advisor) to determine the most statistically principled approach. After converging on 'bootstrap the entire pipeline', the agent implemented this feature for both split and k-fold CV modes, and updated all relevant documentation.",
