  "primary_success": "Driving a complex research investigation from start to finish: identifying a data discrepancy, forming a hypothesis, running new experiments (restoring/creating/evaluating 12 prompts), analyzing the results to find a key insight (dataset and model dependency), and updating the entire experimental configuration and documentation based on the findings.",
  "brief_summary": "The user initiated an investigation into why prompts from a paper were failing an evaluation pipeline. This led to a deep-dive where Claude restored archived prompts, created new domain-specific ones, and strengthened their language. After running the pipeline, Claude analyzed the results, discovered key dataset- and model-dependent effects, and refactored the entire configuration and documentation to support per-model prompt selection based on these new empirical findings.",
