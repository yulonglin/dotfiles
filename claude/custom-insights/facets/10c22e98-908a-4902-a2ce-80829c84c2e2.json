  "friction_detail": "The session involved multiple rounds of fine-tuning figure sizes and placement to meet a strict page limit, a slow and iterative process. The session ended when a compilation command was killed, leaving the final state unverified.",
  "primary_success": "Claude successfully interpreted and executed a series of nuanced layout changes, including adding new figures, resizing existing ones, moving a figure to the appendix, and then promoting other figures from the appendix while cutting text to make space.",
  "brief_summary": "The user guided Claude through several iterative layout adjustments to a LaTeX paper to meet a 4-page limit. This involved adding a new figure, resizing others, moving a figure to the appendix, and later promoting different figures from the appendix while condensing text. The session ended with an unverified state after a compile command was killed.",
