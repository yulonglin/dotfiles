  "friction_detail": "Briefly was overconfident about the `.claude/rules/` feature, but then course-corrected by verifying its existence and documentation before proceeding.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully navigating a complex refactoring of a critical instruction file, balancing conciseness with detail, and exploring/verifying advanced features of the Claude Code environment to arrive at a well-reasoned final structure.",
  "brief_summary": "The user wanted to refactor a very long `CLAUDE.md` file. Claude drastically condensed it, then worked with the user to iteratively add back essential details, discussing the tradeoffs of different context-providing mechanisms like separate docs folders and skills. The session ended with a much shorter, better-structured file that still contained all the critical guidance.",
