  "friction_detail": "Claude initially went down the wrong path, assuming cache corruption and creating a cache regeneration script, before realizing the true root cause was that a critical `epochs: 4` parameter had been removed from the configuration, explaining the discrepancy in results.",
  "primary_success": "Correctly identifying the root cause of the result discrepancy by tracing it back to a specific commit (`a937419`) that removed the `epochs: 4` parameter, and then successfully re-implementing the functionality across the entire pipeline (config, runner, cache, CLI).",
  "brief_summary": "The user reported a discrepancy in prompt selection results (9 passing vs. 26 in a report). Claude investigated, initially suspecting cache corruption, but ultimately traced the root cause to an `epochs=4` parameter that was removed from the config. Claude then successfully re-implemented `epochs` support across the configuration, runner, and caching logic to restore the original methodology.",
