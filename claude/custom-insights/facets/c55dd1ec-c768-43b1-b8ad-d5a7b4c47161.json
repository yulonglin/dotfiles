  "friction_detail": "Claude initially deleted the user's implementation in the `backup` and `restore` methods, replacing it with TODO stubs. After the user complained, Claude apologized and corrected its approach by restoring the user's original logic and applying the necessary fixes directly.",
  "primary_success": "After a misstep, Claude successfully course-corrected by restoring the user's implementation and applying fixes, then created a comprehensive new test suite from scratch that verified the correctness of the complex backup/restore logic.",
  "brief_summary": "The user requested a review of their in-memory database implementation. Claude identified several critical bugs related to sorting, TTL logic, and the backup/restore mechanism. After a minor misstep of overwriting the user's code (which it then corrected), Claude fixed the bugs and wrote a new, comprehensive test suite of 7 tests which all passed, validating the final implementation.",
