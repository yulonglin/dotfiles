  "friction_detail": "Initially, the agent added the 'selective_underperformance' prompt without noting that its 'dual-use danger' framing might not be effective on the project's datasets (MATH, GPQA), which the user pointed out.",
  "primary_success": "Not only implementing the spec correctly, but also proactively analyzing the new prompts for dataset compatibility and adding clear warning comments to the files and `CATALOGUE.yaml` about potential ineffectiveness.",
  "brief_summary": "Following a spec, the agent added several new sandbagging prompts from the research literature to the project. After initial implementation, the user prompted the agent to check for dataset-compatibility issues. The agent correctly identified that one prompt's framing was unsuitable for the project's datasets and updated all relevant files with clear warnings and compatibility notes.",
