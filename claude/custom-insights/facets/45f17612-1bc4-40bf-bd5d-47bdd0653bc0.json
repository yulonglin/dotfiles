  "friction_detail": "Session ran out of context twice, requiring manual summarization to continue. Initial script had multiple bugs requiring debugging. The scorer for behavioral probes was found to be highly inaccurate, requiring significant debugging and a switch to a rule-based approach.",
  "primary_success": "Identified a fundamental flaw in the `weighted_residual` calculation (using absolute value), consulted a research advisor, and implemented a one-sided residual fix which significantly improved detection AUROC from 0.896 to 0.950.",
  "brief_summary": "The user initiated a difficulty-correlation detection analysis. Claude executed the pipeline, debugged multiple issues in the underlying scripts, and successfully generated results. A key insight was collaboratively discovered: the scoring formula was flawed. After fixing it based on a research advisor's input, detection performance improved dramatically. The analysis was then extended to v4.1 stealth prompts, revealing their near-undetectability, and later compared against the C3 detection method.",
