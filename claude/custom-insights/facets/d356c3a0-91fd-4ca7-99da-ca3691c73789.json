  "primary_success": "Claude correctly identified and modified over 10 figure width definitions in the LaTeX source to reduce their size by 50% as an initial step to reduce paper length.",
  "brief_summary": "To reduce a paper's page count, the user first asked the assistant to shrink figures, which it did successfully. After assessing the remaining work, the assistant generated a detailed plan to cut 1.5 pages, but the user rejected it for being too aggressive. The session ended with a revised, user-approved plan ready for implementation.",
