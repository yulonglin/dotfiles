  "brief_summary": "The user asked how 'prefilled' sandbagging prompts were being used. Through code exploration, Claude discovered that although a `prefill_conversation` data structure was defined in a YAML configuration, no code ever read or used this field. The agent correctly concluded the feature was unimplemented and explained what would be required to make it functional.",
