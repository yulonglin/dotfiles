  "friction_detail": "The session involved several failed background tasks due to incorrect configs or timeouts, which required Claude to backtrack and fix the commands. There was also an initial misunderstanding of the prompt selection requirements that the user had to clarify.",
  "primary_success": "Discovering the critical bug in the prompt selection caching logic (`_get_cached_measurement`) that was silently causing incorrect results, and then uncovering the non-obvious relationship between `reasoning_effort` and sandbagging effectiveness in gpt-5-nano.",
  "brief_summary": "The session began with a request to update a paper's prompt selection results. This led to the discovery of a critical bug in the selection pipeline's caching logic, which was incorrectly evaluating prompts based on a single model. After fixing the bug, a deeper investigation revealed that increasing `reasoning_effort` from \"minimal\" to \"low\" for gpt-5-nano paradoxically produced a 5x stronger sandbagging effect, a significant research finding that was validated through controlled experiments.",
