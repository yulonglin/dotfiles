  "friction_detail": "The agent's attempts to reinstall the application were repeatedly blocked. First by a `cp -i` alias, then by race conditions with `trash`, and finally by a permissions deny-list for `rm -rf`. This required multiple manual interventions and debugging steps to resolve.",
  "primary_success": "Systematically debugged and fixed a failing transcript enhancer prompt by applying research-backed techniques, while also navigating and resolving a series of complex tool and permission failures during the installation process.",
  "brief_summary": "The user reported that a transcript enhancer was adding conversational filler. Claude identified weak instructions as the cause, researched prompt engineering best practices, and implemented a robust new prompt and an output filter. The session also involved significant debugging of the installation process, navigating `cp` aliases, `trash` command issues, and `rm -rf` permissions, ultimately resulting in both a fixed application and hardened project settings.",
