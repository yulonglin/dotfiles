  "friction_detail": "During implementation, Claude accidentally renamed the existing 'config' secret to 'ssh_config', which would have broken compatibility. However, Claude immediately caught and corrected this mistake before proceeding.",
  "primary_success": "Designed and implemented a robust system for syncing `authorized_keys`, including proactively asking the user to define the desired merge strategy for local public keys.",
  "brief_summary": "User wanted to sync `authorized_keys` via the existing secrets gist. Claude designed a solution, clarified with the user how to handle auto-adding local keys, then implemented the feature into the `sync_secrets` script. The implementation included logic to find and append the local public key before syncing, which was then committed.",
