  "friction_detail": "The initial model card download failed due to a network proxy issue, requiring a `curl` workaround. The data pipeline repeatedly failed due to malformed JSON from an LLM, which required a lengthy and complex debugging session to make the parsing logic more robust.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully debugged and hardened a fragile data pipeline that was failing on malformed JSON from an LLM, implementing robust error handling that allowed the pipeline to complete and process all required data.",
  "brief_summary": "The user provided a plan to fix missing models and UI bugs. Claude fixed the UI rendering issue, but then encountered a network error downloading a model card and a persistent JSON parsing error in the data pipeline. After working around the network issue with `curl`, Claude performed a deep debugging session, successfully hardening the JSON parsing logic to handle malformed LLM responses and getting the pipeline to process all 7 models correctly.",
