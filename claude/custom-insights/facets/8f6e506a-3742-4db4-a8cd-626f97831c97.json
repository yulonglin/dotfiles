  "brief_summary": "The user asked about result reporting documentation. The agent found it was fragmented across multiple files with inconsistencies. This led to a larger effort where the agent created a new consolidated reporting checklist, corrected the use of k=5 to k=10 to match the paper, clarified statistical terminology, and identified a major gap in the code's ability to produce SEM for split-mode, teeing up the next session's work.",
