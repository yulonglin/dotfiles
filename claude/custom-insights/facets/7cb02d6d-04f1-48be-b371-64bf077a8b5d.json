  "friction_detail": "Claude initially believed the full skill files were loaded at startup, but then corrected this understanding based on official docs (only name/description are loaded at start, full file on activation). It still proceeded with the refactoring as it was a recommended best practice.",
  "primary_success": "Correctly identifying that large, embedded templates within skill files were the cause of high token counts and systematically refactoring them into reference files to be loaded on-demand, following the progressive disclosure pattern.",
  "brief_summary": "The user asked why some skills had high token counts. Claude investigated and found that large templates were embedded directly in the skill files. After a brief misunderstanding and self-correction about token loading, Claude proceeded to refactor five skills/commands, moving bulky content into reference files to be loaded on-demand, dramatically reducing their static complexity.",
