  "brief_summary": "The user requested specific USACO lie detector performance metrics for a mixed-model v4.1 experiment. After a thorough search, the agent determined that while the raw experimental data had been generated and saved in .eval log files, the final metrics (AUROC, recall) had not yet been extracted into CSV or JSON files. The agent precisely identified the correct log directory and provided the exact commands needed to process the logs and generate the desired results.",
