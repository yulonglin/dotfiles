  "friction_detail": "A cascade of latent bugs were discovered: 1) pipeline silently failed on multi-model input, 2) configs had incorrect/missing fields, 3) CI was calculated but not displayed, 4) old cache format prevented CI calculation, 5) log file globbing was incorrect. All were fixed.",
  "primary_success": "Systematically identified and fixed a chain of five distinct bugs in the prompt selection pipeline, ultimately enabling a correct, robust run that produced valid scientific results with proper confidence intervals.",
  "brief_summary": "The user tried to run the prompt selection pipeline, which kicked off a deep debugging session. The agent identified and fixed five separate issues: a silent multi-model failure, incorrect configuration files, missing CI display in reports, an outdated cache format, and a file globbing bug. After fixing all issues, the agent successfully re-ran the pipeline for two models across two datasets and summarized the valid results.",
