  "friction_detail": "Claude initially hallucinated a bug fix, then proposed a multi-model approach that merged results incorrectly. The subsequent implementation had a cache-loading bug that caused one model to fail silently.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully refactored a complex, slow pipeline from using sequential subprocesses to a much faster native batch evaluation, and correctly diagnosed and fixed a subtle caching bug that emerged from the new design.",
  "brief_summary": "The user requested a major refactoring of the prompt selection pipeline to improve performance by removing subprocesses. Claude implemented the change, but this led to a series of iterative refinements to handle multi-model processing and a subtle caching bug. The session concluded with a simplified and robust single-model pipeline being committed.",
