  "friction_detail": "The debugging process was inefficient. Claude focused on fixing the plugin cache and installation registry for a long time, when the root cause was a stale reference in `settings.json`. This led to many unnecessary steps before the simple, final solution was found.",
  "primary_success": "Claude systematically investigated multiple potential points of failure (marketplace, installed plugins, cache) until it finally identified the root cause in the settings file.",
  "brief_summary": "A user reported a plugin loading failure after a rename. The session became a lengthy debugging process where Claude initially focused on stale caches and installation files. After several failed attempts, the root cause was traced to a stale plugin name in `settings.json`. The session concluded by correcting the configuration and pruning a maintenance document to reflect the simpler solution.",
