  "friction_detail": "Claude initially added a slide about 'lie detector evasion' results, but then correctly identified the underlying detector was confounded and removed the slide to avoid presenting misleading data.",
  "primary_success": "Proactively identified that a seemingly interesting result ('lie detector evasion') was based on a confounded detector and removed it from the presentation, ensuring the scientific integrity of the slides.",
  "brief_summary": "The user requested an update to the 'week 20' research slides. Claude initially added a new result about lie detector evasion, but then, during a self-critique phase, realized the result was based on a confounded detector and removed it. After making other minor clarity improvements, Claude committed and pushed the final changes.",
