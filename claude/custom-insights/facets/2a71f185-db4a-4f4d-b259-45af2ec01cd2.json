  "friction_detail": "A key point of friction was clarifying the type of 'refusal' the filter should detect, which was resolved through discussion. A code review also failed due to a mismatch between the working directory and the committed code, requiring a `git checkout` to resolve. A faulty heuristic (flagging single letters as refusal) was also identified and fixed.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully implemented the core filter and embedding modules of the pipeline, including navigating a critical terminology clarification with the user ('task refusal' vs 'sandbag refusal') to ensure the logic matched the spec. Also, successfully debugged a code review failure caused by a repository state mismatch.",
  "brief_summary": "The user asked to implement tasks 2-4 of the prompt selection pipeline. The assistant implemented the cache, filter, and embedding modules with tests. The process involved a key clarification on terminology ('task refusal'), debugging a code review failure caused by uncommitted files, and fixing several issues identified by reviewer agents, resulting in robust and well-tested foundational components.",
