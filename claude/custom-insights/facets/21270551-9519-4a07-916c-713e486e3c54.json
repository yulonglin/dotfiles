  "friction_detail": "The sandbox ironically blocked the `git commit` command that was saving the sandbox configuration, because the git command's heredoc created a temp file outside the CWD. This required using the sandbox escape hatch.",
  "primary_success": "Claude provided a very clear and effective mental model (bouncer vs. jail) to explain the complex interaction between the permission system and the OS-level sandbox, helping the user understand the security layers.",
  "brief_summary": "The user engaged in a deep exploratory session to understand Claude Code's sandboxing feature. Claude provided detailed explanations using analogies, clarified the interaction with 'yolo mode' and various settings, and discussed edge cases like `pkill` and `docker`. The session concluded with the user making informed decisions to update their global configuration, which Claude implemented and committed.",
