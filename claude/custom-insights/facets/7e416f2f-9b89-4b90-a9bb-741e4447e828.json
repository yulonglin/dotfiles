  "friction_detail": "The session encountered multiple transient API connection errors during large-scale data generation, requiring restarts. A major point of friction was discovering late in the process that the initial experiments had unintentionally used an old version of paraphrase strategies (v2.1 instead of the intended v3.2 + v4), forcing a large-scale regeneration of data. The most fundamental friction was the initial premise of embedding explanations for coding tasks, which was ultimately proven to be an ineffective approach.",
  "primary_success": "Claude's most valuable contribution was the final root-cause analysis that pinpointed why the detection method was failing for the USACO coding dataset. By comparing the content of sandbagging vs. normal responses, Claude demonstrated that the semantic signal was in the generated code (which wasn't being analyzed), not the text explanations (which were), thereby correctly identifying the flawed premise and paving the way for a more promising code-specific analysis.",
  "brief_summary": "The user and Claude collaborated on a deep research task to improve AI sandbagging detection using paraphrased prompts. Through multiple cycles of experimentation, they discovered the method failed for coding tasks because the signal was in the code, not the text explanations. Claude successfully root-caused this failure, tested and disproved a mitigation hypothesis (longer explanations), and created a detailed plan for a more promising, code-centric detection method.",
