  "friction_detail": "A bug was discovered in the ensemble script where Lie Detector scores were being inverted twice, effectively negating their signal and making the ensembling approach incorrect. This was fixed by removing the redundant inversion flag.",
  "primary_success": "While investigating scoring and normalization conventions, Claude discovered and fixed a subtle but critical bug in the ensemble detector script that was causing a double-inversion of scores.",
  "brief_summary": "The user's questions about score normalization across different detectors led Claude to investigate the ensemble script. This investigation uncovered a critical bug where scores were being inverted twice. Claude fixed the bug, generalized the ensemble script to be more flexible, updated the documentation, and committed the changes.",
