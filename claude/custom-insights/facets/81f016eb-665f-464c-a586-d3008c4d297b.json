  "brief_summary": "The user asked if it was safe to add their SSH config to a public dotfiles repo. The agent analyzed the config, identified the sensitive information (IPs, usernames), and strongly advised against publishing it as-is. After discussing alternatives like using templates or private gists, the agent fulfilled a follow-up request to add a new host entry to the user's local SSH config file.",
