  "friction_detail": "The agent accidentally overwrote the file while trying to apply an edit, losing other uncommitted changes the user had made before the session began. This caused confusion during the final commit.",
  "primary_success": "Identifying subtle overclaiming in the paper's abstract and introduction and suggesting a precise, well-justified textual hedge to improve its honesty and accuracy.",
  "brief_summary": "The user asked the agent to check for overclaiming in a research paper. The agent identified misleading language and suggested a hedge, which it applied. However, a tool error caused an accidental file overwrite, losing some of the user's other uncommitted changes, though the primary goal of hedging the text was eventually committed.",
