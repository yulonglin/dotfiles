  "friction_detail": "Claude's initial analysis incorrectly claimed meta prompts lacked deception instructions, requiring the user to ask follow-up questions to get a more accurate assessment.",
  "primary_success": "Systematically analyzing 101 prompts in detail, categorizing their flaws, and providing specific, actionable recommendations for three different datasets, which saved significant manual review time.",
  "brief_summary": "The user requested a review of a sandbagging prompt catalogue. Claude performed a detailed analysis, identifying issues with many prompts being non-applicable or unrealistic. After user correction on the nature of 'meta prompts', a complete and nuanced understanding of the catalogue's strengths and weaknesses was achieved.",
