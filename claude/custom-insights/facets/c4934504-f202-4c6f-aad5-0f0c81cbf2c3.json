  "primary_success": "Correctly analyzing the user's remotely-developed changes, understanding why they were superior (identifying orphaned processes via ppid=1), and gracefully abandoning its own work in favor of the better solution.",
  "brief_summary": "The user inquired about 'unknown' processes in a script. Claude investigated and proposed adding more diagnostics. However, the user revealed they had already implemented a better fix on another machine, which Claude then pulled, analyzed, and confirmed was a superior approach.",
