  "friction_detail": "The assistant initially modified several prompts that the user considered to be paper baselines which should have been left untouched, requiring a partial revert of the changes.",
  "primary_success": "Systematically identifying distinct failure modes (refusal, negative gap, leakage) from pipeline reports and applying targeted, appropriate fixes to each prompt.",
  "brief_summary": "The user asked the assistant to fix sandbagging prompts that failed evaluation. The assistant analyzed pipeline reports, implemented fixes across 11 prompts to address issues like high refusal rates and poor sandbagging performance, and refined the changes based on user feedback about which prompts to leave untouched.",
