  "primary_success": "Identified and fixed a critical bug in the 'Supervisor Audit' evaluation where the evaluation would end before the model could respond to direct questions, and implemented a new state machine phase ('audit_questions_received') to correctly capture and score the model's responses for deception.",
  "brief_summary": "The user tasked Claude with extending an evaluation to better test for scheming. Claude identified a bug in the audit protocol that prevented the model from responding to questions, fixed it by adding a new phase to the state machine, and enhanced the scoring logic. It then documented the design and clearly explained the bug and the fix to the user.",
