  "friction_detail": "The .gitignore file was preventing the new .pkl model files from being tracked, which was resolved by using `git add --force`.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully migrated the project from a broken symlink to version-controlled lie detector model files, updating all relevant configuration and documentation to use the new 'worst-performing' classifiers for experiments.",
  "brief_summary": "The user tasked the assistant with updating the project's lie detector models to use the most evasive versions for experiments. The assistant copied the necessary model files, updated the central `models.yaml` registry, fixed all related documentation in the specs, force-added the ignored `.pkl` files to git, and then committed and pushed all changes, completing the entire workflow.",
