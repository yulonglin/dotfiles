  "friction_detail": "The initial fix using `\\PROCEDURE` failed to render. A second attempt to use the modern `algpseudocode` package also failed due to a conflict with the ICML style file. The agent had to research the style file constraints and fall back to a manually formatted solution compatible with the legacy `algorithmic` package.",
  "primary_success": "Diagnosing an algorithm clarity issue and proposing a standard subroutine-based solution. After hitting LaTeX package conflicts, the agent correctly identified the ICML style file constraint and implemented a robust, manually-formatted version that was both clear and compliant.",
  "brief_summary": "The user wanted to improve the clarity of an algorithm's pseudocode in a paper. The agent identified that a shared computation step was not explicitly defined and proposed extracting it into a subroutine. After failed attempts with standard LaTeX packages due to conflicts with the ICML style file, the agent researched the constraints and implemented a clear, manually formatted version that was compliant with the conference requirements.",
