  "friction_detail": "Claude initially gave incorrect advice about using a `.env` file, as the project didn't load them. It also struggled to run tests, first due to missing Go, then due to integration tests not respecting the `-short` flag.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully implemented six distinct security fixes, correctly using Go build tags to separate production and development logic for the 'demo' mode and 'insecure TLS' features. Also provided an excellent explanation of a symlink attack vulnerability.",
  "brief_summary": "Following a detailed security plan, Claude implemented fixes for multiple vulnerabilities, including a critical symlink attack vector and an auth bypass. The implementation correctly used Go build tags to conditionally compile development-only code. Despite some friction around running tests and a mistake in advising on `.env` files (which it later corrected), Claude successfully completed all required code changes.",
