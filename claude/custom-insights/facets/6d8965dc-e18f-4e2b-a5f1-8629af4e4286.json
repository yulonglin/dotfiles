  "friction_detail": "Claude initially struggled to read the provided PNG image file, requiring multiple tool attempts before finally using Tesseract OCR to extract the text content.",
  "primary_success": "Correctly identifying that the content from the image represented a completely different version of the same problem (NMIMS vs. Hack2Hire) and, at the user's direction, separating the content into two distinct markdown files instead of incorrectly merging them.",
  "brief_summary": "The user asked to add content from a large image to a markdown file. After overcoming difficulties reading the image, Claude extracted the text and realized it was a different version of the same coding problem. It first overwrote the existing file, but then, following the user's clarification, it correctly separated the two versions into distinct files and updated the project's README.",
