  "friction_detail": "The pipeline failed to run multiple times due to various JSON parsing errors, requiring Claude to iteratively improve the JSON normalization and extraction logic.",
  "primary_success": "Claude correctly identified and fixed a critical bug in the scoring logic (no evidence should equal a score of 0) and simultaneously worked to debug and harden a fragile data pipeline.",
  "brief_summary": "The user reported a scoring bug and a UI issue. Claude correctly fixed the critical scoring logic error. It then began re-running the data pipeline, which failed multiple times due to JSON parsing issues, prompting Claude to iteratively harden the parser. The session ended with the pipeline still running but the core bug fixed.",
