  "primary_success": "Successfully identified the lack of fact-checking as a gap, designed a new 'FACT_CHECK_PROMPT', and correctly integrated it into the existing multi-phase Python pipeline, updating all relevant functions and prompts.",
  "brief_summary": "The user asked if the brainstorming pipeline flags incorrect facts. The agent identified this as a gap, then implemented a new fact-checking phase. This involved creating a new prompt, updating several Python functions to run critique and fact-checking in parallel, and modifying the final synthesis step to incorporate the new fact-checking outputs.",
