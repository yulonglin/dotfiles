  "primary_success": "Discovered and synthesized the critical insight that 'eval-like' paraphrase strategies dramatically outperform diversity-optimized ones, proving that behavioral relevance is more important than simple stylistic diversity for detection.",
  "brief_summary": "The user tasked Claude with researching paraphrase strategy diversity. Claude investigated the Vendi score pipeline, analyzed experimental results, and discovered that strategies directly referencing 'evaluation' were far more effective for detection than simply diverse ones. The session produced a detailed report contrasting the two approaches.",
