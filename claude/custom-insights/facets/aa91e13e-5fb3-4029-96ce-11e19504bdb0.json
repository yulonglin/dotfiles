  "friction_detail": "Session experienced LaTeX compilation failures due to missing packages (`multirow`, `enumitem`) and line-ending issues. Additionally, an incorrect paraphrase strategy (`decoy_benchmark_gpqa`) was initially documented for the MATH dataset, requiring user correction.",
  "primary_success": "Reconstructing the correct paraphrase selection methodology from source files (`.yaml`, `.json`), correcting outdated information in the paper, and generating a complete LaTeX appendix with all the relevant prompts.",
  "brief_summary": "The user asked to document the paraphrase strategy selection process in a LaTeX paper. Claude investigated source files to find the correct methodology, updated the paper text, and generated a new appendix with strategy prompts. After several rounds of debugging LaTeX compilation errors and correcting a strategy mismatch found by the user, all changes were successfully committed and pushed.",
