  "brief_summary": "The user requested a brainstorm for black-box sandbagging detection methods. Claude ran a multi-LLM pipeline and synthesized the results, producing five promising and sophisticated research directions, including differential calibration analysis and indirect dependency probing, and outlined a concrete first experiment.",
