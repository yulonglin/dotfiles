  "brief_summary": "The user asked to complete the spec for `gpt-5-nano`. Claude wrote the full specification, highlighting the critical `reasoning_effort: low` setting. It then identified that experiment configs for GPQA and MATH were missing, created the necessary paraphraser and experiment YAML files, and included quick-start commands in the final documentation.",
