  "friction_detail": "Claude initially tried updating a dependency that didn't fix the issue, then proposed using npm overrides which broke the build due to transitive dependency conflicts. A custom upgrade script also had an initial bug. The process involved multiple reverts and retries to diagnose the complex dependency issues.",
  "primary_success": "Correctly diagnosed that a build failure was caused by an upstream bug in a new Gatsby version (5.16.0) and implemented a robust solution by pinning the `gatsby` dependency to a known working version (5.15.0) and creating a safe upgrade script that respects version pins.",
  "brief_summary": "The user reported build errors and warnings in their Gatsby project. Claude led a deep, iterative debugging session, identifying and fixing issues with bun commands, deprecated plugin options, and dependency conflicts. After discovering an upstream bug in Gatsby 5.16.0, Claude successfully pinned the version to 5.15.0 and created a safe, intelligent upgrade script to prevent future breakages, ultimately leaving the project in a stable state.",
