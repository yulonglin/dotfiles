  "primary_success": "Discovered that the in-context scheming prompts were completely ineffective on the target model (gpt-4.1-nano), diagnosed the reasons (model difference, setup fidelity, unrealistic threshold), and demonstrated through live tests that models would reason about the scheming premise but still answer correctly.",
  "brief_summary": "The user wanted to compare local scheming prompts to the original Apollo paper. The agent analyzed both, identified key differences, and then investigated performance data, discovering the prompts were completely ineffective. Through a series of tests, it demonstrated that models would acknowledge the scheming context but refuse to actually underperform, providing a clear recommendation for how to fix the prompts.",
