  "brief_summary": "The user wanted to better contextualize the baselines used in a research paper. Claude identified the weak framing, drafted new text explaining why lie detectors and trusted monitors were chosen, updated the introduction, and added a note clarifying the relationship to concurrent work from UK AISI. The agent iteratively refined the text based on user feedback.",
