  },
  "friction_detail": "A background research agent failed, but the necessary information was already obtained through other means, so it didn't block progress.",
  "primary_success": "Claude provided a comprehensive, expert-level breakdown of the technical and governance-related challenges of black-box compute estimation, including identifying key confounders like quantization, MoE, and hardware differences.",
  "brief_summary": "The user and Claude collaborated to refine a hackathon project idea for AI governance. Starting with a list of technical questions, they explored the nuances of estimating training FLOPs from API access, identified critical confounders, curated a list of test models from OpenRouter, and iteratively developed a robust project proposal, reframing the goal from simple FLOPs estimation to a more novel 'behavioral fingerprinting' for model architecture classification.",
