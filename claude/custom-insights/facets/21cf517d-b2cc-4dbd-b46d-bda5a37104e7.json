  "friction_detail": "Encountered sandbox permission issues when trying to remove read-only files and run the full deploy script. Also, a Python test script failed due to a missing dependency and a code indentation error, which required a targeted fix and then a change in verification strategy.",
  "primary_success": "Claude successfully navigated a complex, multi-step refactoring task involving code, configuration, deployment scripts, and documentation. It adeptly handled gitignore rules, refactored Python code to use shared constants, and systematically updated all related documentation, demonstrating end-to-end implementation capability.",
  "brief_summary": "Claude implemented a plan to refactor the plotting library. This involved creating a new `lib/plotting` directory, moving and refactoring Python modules, updating matplotlib style files, modifying deployment scripts (`deploy.sh`, `.zshrc`), and updating all relevant documentation (`CLAUDE.md`, READMEs). Despite some sandbox permission issues which required workarounds, the refactor was successfully completed and committed across ten separate logical commits.",
