  },
  "friction_detail": "The implementation process involved significant debugging, with multiple test runs failing due to configuration errors. Additionally, a subtle prompt conflict was discovered where the Meinke prompt's instructions for a minimal answer format clashed with the evaluation task's requirement for step-by-step reasoning.",
  "primary_success": "Diagnosing the subtle model behavior issue where a prompt instruction ('no additional reasoning') conflicted with the task format, which was causing the model to give incorrect responses.",
  "brief_summary": "The user tasked the assistant with completing a partially implemented plan for a 'no-goal sandbagging' feature. The assistant implemented the feature, which involved a new solver and core code changes, then undertook an extensive debugging process to resolve numerous configuration errors and test failures. It also diagnosed and fixed two subtle model behavior issues caused by prompt conflicts and output style mismatches.",
