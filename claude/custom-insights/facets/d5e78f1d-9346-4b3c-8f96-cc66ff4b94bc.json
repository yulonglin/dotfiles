  "friction_detail": "Claude's initial attempt was to remove all mentions of 'trusted monitoring', but the user wanted to keep the term and just fix its definition. This required backtracking and re-implementing the changes with the correct narrative structure.",
  "primary_success": "After an initial misstep, Claude correctly refactored the entire paper to distinguish between 'trusted monitoring' (black-box output analysis), 'behavioral probes' (direct questions), and 'lie detectors', ensuring the narrative and results were consistent with the new definitions.",
  "brief_summary": "The user tasked Claude with correcting the definition of 'trusted monitors' in a research paper. Claude's first attempt was to remove the term entirely, which the user corrected. Claude then successfully revised the paper to correctly define and differentiate between trusted monitors, behavioral probes, and lie detectors, updating the text, tables, and figures accordingly before committing the changes.",
