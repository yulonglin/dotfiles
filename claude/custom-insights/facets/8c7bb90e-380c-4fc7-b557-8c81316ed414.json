  "friction_detail": "The assistant initially misunderstood the user's instruction to 'not include the failed paths', interpreting it as a request to omit certain experiments from the slide. The user clarified that they wanted all items included for discussion, and the assistant corrected the slide.",
  "primary_success": "Effectively translated a raw, unstructured list of research tasks into a clear, prioritized 'Next Steps' presentation slide suitable for a research meeting, and iteratively refined it based on user feedback.",
  "brief_summary": "The user provided a list of research tasks and asked to update the 'Next Steps' slide for a presentation. The assistant structured the tasks into a slide, and after a brief misunderstanding about which items to include, worked with the user to iteratively refine the content into a ranked priority list for discussion. The final slide accurately reflected the user's desired plan.",
