  "primary_success": "Claude synthesized evidence from multiple sources (docs, slides, CSVs) to co-develop a much stronger, more nuanced argument, identifying three distinct failure modes for lie detectors (transfer failure, identity confound, training data assumption) and finding specific data to back up each claim.",
  "brief_summary": "The user and Claude collaborated to overhaul the paper's section on lie detectors. They moved from a simple 'supervised methods fail' claim to a sophisticated argument based on three distinct, evidence-backed failure modes: transfer failure from general lies to sandbagging, model identity confounds, and the violation of the training data assumption. Claude found specific data points for each failure mode and updated the paper's abstract, introduction, and results sections accordingly.",
