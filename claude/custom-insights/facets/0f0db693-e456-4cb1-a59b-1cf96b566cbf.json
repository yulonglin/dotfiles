  "friction_detail": "Initial attempts to speed up animations resulted in a 'jittery' user experience. Refactoring the animation logic into a centralized config file led to several runtime errors due to module loading order issues, which required debugging.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully centralized all website animation settings into a single `animationConfig` object in `src/config.js`, including a master toggle and a feature flag for the loader, while also debugging and fixing the resulting runtime errors.",
  "brief_summary": "The user wanted to improve page load speed. Claude first adjusted animation timings, but this caused jitteriness. After user feedback, Claude removed staggered animations for a smoother effect. The user then requested a feature flag for the loader and centralization of all animation configs. Claude refactored the code to use a single config object, debugged several resulting runtime errors, and successfully delivered the feature.",
