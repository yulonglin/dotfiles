  "friction_detail": "Initially, Claude's analysis of prompt overlap was not granular enough (not per-dataset). The user corrected this, leading to a deeper analysis. Claude also added redundant information to one of the documents, which the user asked to be removed.",
  "primary_success": "Performed a detailed prompt overlap analysis between training and evaluation sets, revealing that the utility of certain lie detectors varied significantly by dataset (e.g., USACO tests were pure transfer), which critically informed the experiment design.",
  "brief_summary": "User and Claude collaborated to select lie detector baselines for sandbagging experiments. Claude analyzed classifier performance and the prompt overlap between training and evaluation sets, leading to the discovery that experiments on the USACO dataset would primarily test for transfer learning. The final selections and analysis were documented in the project specs and committed.",
