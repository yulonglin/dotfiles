  "primary_success": "Using an interview process to distill a complex document of concerns into a concrete specification with clear decisions on terminology, claim strength, and experimental reporting. A key insight was clarifying the term 'in-context scheming' as more accurate than 'no-goal sandbagging' for the user's setup.",
  "brief_summary": "The user needed to address a complex document of concerns for a paper overhaul. The agent initiated a spec interview, asking targeted questions to clarify framing, terminology, and scope, and also conducted research on related work. The process resulted in a consolidated spec document with key decisions and a clear definition of 'in-context scheming' to describe the user's methodology.",
