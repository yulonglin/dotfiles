  "friction_detail": "The initial experiments were flawed because they used gpt-4.1-nano as the normal baseline against a gpt-5-nano sandbagger. This meant the results were confounded by model capability differences. The entire experiment had to be re-run with gpt-5-nano as the baseline for both normal and sandbagging models.",
  "primary_success": "Identifying that the experimental baseline was confounded (gpt-4.1 vs gpt-5) and re-running all experiments with a proper same-model baseline to get clean results.",
  "brief_summary": "Tasked with verifying if v4.1 prompts defeat lie detectors, Claude ran a series of experiments. It discovered the initial setup was flawed due to a model mismatch in the baseline. After creating 'proper baseline' configs and re-running, Claude confirmed that v4.1 prompts successfully defeat both lie detector and embedding entropy detection methods.",
