  "primary_success": "Clarified that while Stage 1 filters are logically sequential, they all operate on a single set of shared model outputs, and that the ordering is based on discriminating power rather than computational cost.",
  "brief_summary": "The user asked for a review of the sandbagging prompt filtering order. Claude compared the spec and the paper, confirmed they were aligned, and explained the 'cheapest first' logic. Claude clarified that the filters share the same N=100 evaluation outputs and the order prioritizes discriminating power. The user and Claude concluded no major changes were needed.",
