  "friction_detail": "Claude silently substituted a missing bibtex entry instead of flagging it, which the user had to call out. The generated paper was too short for the user's taste, and a generated table's content was deemed incorrect, leading to the user asking to delete it and re-plan the expansion.",
  "primary_success": "Claude successfully pulled together a large amount of content from a source document (`main.tex`) and a detailed plan to generate a complex LaTeX paper with a 12-section appendix and numerous figures.",
  "brief_summary": "Claude implemented a detailed plan to expand a paper to 4 pages, pulling content and figures from various sources. After compiling, the user found the paper was still too short and a data table was incorrect. Claude acknowledged the issue and began re-planning the expansion.",
