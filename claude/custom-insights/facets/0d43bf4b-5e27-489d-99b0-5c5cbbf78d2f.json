  "friction_detail": "The assistant initially generated invalid syntax for the permission deny list (`curl:* | sh`), which caused a settings error and had to be corrected.",
  "primary_success": "Clearly explaining the security rationale for a granular allowlist over a blanket 'Bash' approval, guiding the user toward a safer configuration.",
  "brief_summary": "The user and assistant collaboratively built a security deny list for shell commands. The assistant explained the risks of a blanket approval, then iteratively added categories of destructive commands (`rm`, `git reset`, `dd`, `curl`, `sudo`) to the configuration, fixing a syntax error along the way.",
