  "friction_detail": "The main pipeline script appeared to hang because it was making thousands of API calls without any progress indicator, requiring Claude to add `tqdm` for user feedback. There was also a minor misunderstanding about unreleased OpenAI model names.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully executed a complex, multi-part plan including massively expanding a core JSON data file with dozens of new, granular requirements and building a new human validation UI page in Streamlit.",
  "brief_summary": "Following a detailed plan, Claude expanded the project's requirements from 45 to 80 items and built a new human validation dashboard page. The agent then debugged the main data processing pipeline which appeared to hang by adding a `tqdm` progress bar. The session concluded with a detailed discussion of the pipeline's architecture and model choices, though an underlying issue with the dashboard UI remained unresolved.",
