  "friction_detail": "During the commit process, a `lib/` directory was blocked by `.gitignore`, and a pre-commit hook flagged a public Gist ID as a secret. Claude resolved this by renaming the directory and recognizing the false positive.",
  "primary_success": "Leading a structured design process from a vague goal to a concrete plan, successfully refactoring hundreds of lines of shell script into a modular design with a central config, and navigating tool failures during the final commit.",
  "brief_summary": "The user requested a cleanup of install/deploy scripts. Claude guided a design discussion, settling on a `config.sh` approach. It then executed a major refactoring, extracting settings into `config.sh` and shared logic into `lib/helpers.sh`, significantly simplifying the main scripts before navigating git hook issues to commit the work.",
