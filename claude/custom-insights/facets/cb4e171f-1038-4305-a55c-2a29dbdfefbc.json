  "friction_detail": "Claude initially misdiagnosed the slowness cause (cache size), then had to iterate on the orphan detection logic multiple times after incorrect assumptions were pointed out. A delegation to Codex also failed.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully identified the root cause of an incorrect process count (a zombie process with a zombie parent) and implemented a much more robust orphan/zombie detection logic in the `clear-claude-code` script.",
  "brief_summary": "The user reported system slowness and an incorrect process count. Claude investigated, identifying a zombie process and high-CPU active sessions. The focus shifted to improving the `clear-claude-code` script to automatically detect such zombies, leading to a deep dive into process states and a robust, multi-pronged orphan detection implementation.",
