  "brief_summary": "The user provided a plan to improve the statistical rigor of the bootstrap CV by bootstrapping the entire pipeline. The agent implemented this new logic, adding a `full_pipeline_bootstrap` flag, updated the config, updated several documentation files (CLAUDE.md, STATISTICAL_ANALYSIS.md) to reflect the new best practice, and changed k=5 defaults to k=10 in multiple scripts.",
