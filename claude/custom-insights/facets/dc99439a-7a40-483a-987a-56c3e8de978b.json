  "brief_summary": "The user asked to refactor classifier scripts to remove default hyperparameters and use Hydra. Claude performed a full migration, creating new YAML configs, updating Python scripts, and fixing documentation. The process involved significant debugging of import errors and configuration structure issues, but ultimately resulted in a complete and tested refactor.",
