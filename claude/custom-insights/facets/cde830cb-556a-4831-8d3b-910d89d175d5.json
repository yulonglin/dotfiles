  "primary_success": "Successfully guided and executed a significant refactoring of a research paper to meet a page limit, correctly identifying sections to move to an appendix or condense. Managed the entire iterative process of cutting content, checking word counts, and committing changes until the goal was met.",
  "brief_summary": "The user needed to cut a paper from 9.4 to 8 pages. Claude consulted its `paper-writer` agent for a strategy, then iteratively implemented the suggested cuts (moving sections to an appendix, shortening paragraphs) with user confirmation. After several rounds of edits and word count checks, the 8-page target was successfully reached.",
