  "friction_detail": "The user's initial `curl` test failed with 'Connection refused', indicating the SSH tunnel process was not actually running at that moment, which caused temporary confusion.",
  "primary_success": "Correctly diagnosing the `Connection refused` error, providing the user with commands to check if the process was running (`ps`) and listening (`lsof`), and suggesting a convenient, persistent SSH config entry to automate the tunnel creation.",
  "brief_summary": "The user wanted to forward a remote port via SSH. Claude corrected the initial command syntax, helped debug connection issues ('Broken pipe' and 'Connection refused') by having the user check the remote service and local process status, and finally provided a complete SSH config entry to automate the process, including backgrounding.",
