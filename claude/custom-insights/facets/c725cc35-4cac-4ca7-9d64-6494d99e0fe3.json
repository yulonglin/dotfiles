  "brief_summary": "User wanted to enforce a thin cursor on remote machines. Claude diagnosed that this required changes in three places: the terminal emulator (Ghostty), the shell (zsh), and the terminal multiplexer (tmux). It added the necessary configurations to ensure the cursor style was set and preserved across all environments, then committed the changes.",
