  "friction_detail": "Claude initially misunderstood the output requirements, first trying to modify the generation script (which the user forbade), and then creating its own simplified reports. The user had to clarify that the goal was to use the script's raw output and debug any inconsistencies.",
  "primary_success": "Diagnosing that result discrepancies were caused by stale cache files. Claude correctly identified that multiple cache files existed for the same prompt path due to content changes, and resolved the issue by comparing filename hashes with on-disk prompt content hashes and archiving the stale entries.",
  "brief_summary": "The user asked to generate prompt selection docs. Claude ran the script, but the results didn't match the final reports. After some initial confusion, Claude diagnosed the issue: the cache contained data from old, outdated versions of the prompts. By comparing content hashes, Claude identified and archived stale cache files, then regenerated the correct documentation.",
