  "friction_detail": "Claude initially converged on a single extension idea, and the user had to prompt it to provide more divergent options from the brainstorming material.",
  "primary_success": "After being prompted for more divergence, Claude generated a comprehensive list of distinct, high-quality extension ideas and then provided detailed implementation sketches for the most complex ones on request.",
  "brief_summary": "The user tasked Claude with designing extensions for an AI scheming evaluation based on a provided document. Claude initially synthesized a single proposal, but after user feedback, it generated a rich list of distinct extension ideas. The session involved iterative refinement, where Claude detailed several complex proposals, including a 'Supervisor Audit Protocol' and methods for testing 'Capability vs. Propensity,' culminating in a well-defined plan.",
