  "friction_detail": "Claude's first two attempts to rewrite the remote commit message failed because the chosen git commands required an interactive editor, which it couldn't use. It then successfully used a scripted approach.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully rewriting the commit message of a remote commit using a script-based interactive rebase, and then safely force-pushing with `--force-with-lease`.",
  "brief_summary": "The user needed to reconcile diverged local and remote git branches. Claude pulled remote changes, rebased the local commit, and then improved the vague remote commit message by using a script with `git rebase -i` to provide a detailed, structured message. The session concluded with a safe force-push.",
