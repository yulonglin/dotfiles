  "friction_detail": "The debugging process required several pivots. An initial fix for orphan detection was correct but didn't solve the main problem of stale ACTIVE sessions. The subsequent focus on TTY mtime proved unreliable on macOS, leading to a final, more robust solution based on CPU and process age. Each 'failed' approach was a necessary step in uncovering the true root cause.",
  "primary_success": "Claude demonstrated exceptional systematic debugging. It started with a specific bug (PID 24212), fixed it, then iteratively diagnosed and fixed a series of more subtle issues with 'stale active' processes. It correctly identified unreliable signals (TTY mtime), pivoted to more robust ones (CPU+age), and guided the user through investigation and refinement until the script worked perfectly.",
  "brief_summary": "The user wanted to fix a cleanup script that was failing to kill abandoned processes. Claude first fixed a specific orphan-detection bug. Then, through an iterative process of proposing fixes and analyzing output, it diagnosed that TTY mtime was an unreliable signal on macOS and that multiple processes shared a TTY. It then implemented a more robust, future-proof logic based on CPU usage and process age, successfully resolving all reported issues.",
