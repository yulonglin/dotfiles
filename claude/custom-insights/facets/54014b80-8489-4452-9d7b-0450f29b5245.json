  "friction_detail": "Claude initially claimed `~/.ignore` would be used by ripgrep and fd, but then had to self-correct after verifying that fd uses a different path and ripgrep requires an explicit flag. This led to a correction in the implementation.",
  "primary_success": "Correctly diagnosing that the `/spec-interview` command was redundant because skills are directly invokable, and then deleting it to simplify the configuration.",
  "brief_summary": "The user pointed out that a skill and command had the same name. After consulting an agent guide, Claude determined the command was redundant and deleted it. The user then asked to configure a global `.ignore` file; Claude initially implemented this with a wrong assumption about which tools would use it, but then self-corrected, found the correct paths, and updated the deployment script accordingly.",
