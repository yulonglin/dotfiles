  "brief_summary": "The user questioned if the Vendi score prompt selection was greedy. Claude investigated the codebase, confirmed the use of a greedy algorithm in `embeddings.py`, and explained the complexity and quality tradeoffs compared to beam search or optimal approaches. It concluded that for this specific task, greedy selection was likely sufficient.",
