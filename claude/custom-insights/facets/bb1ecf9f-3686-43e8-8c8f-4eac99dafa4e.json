  "friction_detail": "Claude tried to use a proprietary 'anthroplot' styling package that wasn't available in the environment, requiring it to fall back to standard matplotlib and then be explicitly given the styling code to regenerate the plot correctly.",
  "primary_success": "Claude successfully located specific experimental results within presentation slides, integrated them into the paper (including a nuanced discussion of limitations), and then iteratively converted the results from a table into a publication-quality, custom-styled figure based on user feedback.",
  "brief_summary": "The user asked Claude to identify missing experimental results and then to add 'in-context scheming' results from slides. Claude audited the paper, found the data, and added it. Following user feedback, Claude then replaced the data table with a new plot, and after another feedback loop, restyled the plot using provided code to match brand guidelines before committing and pushing the changes.",
