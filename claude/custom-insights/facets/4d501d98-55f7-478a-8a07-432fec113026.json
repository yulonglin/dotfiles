  "brief_summary": "The user reported duplicate skills. Claude investigated and found 57 symlinks in the user skills directory pointing to the plugin cache were the cause. The session then expanded to a full analysis of cross-tool extensibility, resulting in a comprehensive 7-part plan to fix the duplicates, create new sync scripts for Gemini and Codex, and document the entire ecosystem.",
