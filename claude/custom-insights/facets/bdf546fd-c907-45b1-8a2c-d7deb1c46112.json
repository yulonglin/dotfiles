  "friction_detail": "The TM Judge failed due to a parser error with system messages, which had to be debugged and fixed. The initial statistical analysis was flawed (using CV on the test set and `max` aggregation incorrectly), requiring significant correction. Batch API jobs were extremely slow.",
  "primary_success": "Correctly identifying that the initial cross-prompt aggregation was methodologically flawed and re-running the analysis on a per-prompt basis, which uncovered that the `off_by_one` prompt was uniquely evasive. This changed the conclusion from '100% detection' to a more nuanced understanding of the method's limitations.",
  "brief_summary": "The user requested implementation and evaluation of a 'TM Max Aggregation' detection method. The agent implemented the feature, ran a series of experiments, and debugged a parser failure in the process. Through iterative analysis and responding to user feedback, the agent uncovered critical methodological flaws (mixing prompts, using `max` aggregation) and ultimately produced a robust analysis showing that while `max` aggregation works for some prompts, `p75` or `mean` is better for evasive prompts like `off_by_one`.",
