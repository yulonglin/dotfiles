  "brief_summary": "The user asked to archive or mark specific outdated documentation files (v5.1-v5.3). The agent located the files and, noting they were still useful for some context, opted to add prominent deprecation banners at the top of each file instead of archiving them. This successfully warned future readers of their outdated status for certain use cases.",
