  "friction_detail": "The pipeline had several latent bugs: it silently failed on multi-model configs producing invalid results, older cache files lacked necessary data for CI calculation, and the eval log loader incorrectly used multiple old log files. Claude had to debug each of these issues sequentially.",
  "primary_success": "Diagnosed a silent multi-model configuration bug that was producing invalid metrics, and then further diagnosed that CI calculations were failing due to outdated cache files, improving the report to handle this gracefully.",
  "brief_summary": "User ran the GPQA pipeline and found the output was incorrect. Claude diagnosed and fixed a series of cascading issues: a multi-model bug causing invalid metrics, incorrect config files, missing CI display in reports, and a bug in how evaluation logs were being loaded. The session resulted in a much more robust and transparent pipeline.",
