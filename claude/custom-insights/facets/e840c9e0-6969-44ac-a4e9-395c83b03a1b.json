  "friction_detail": "Session encountered multiple issues: persistent API timeouts during trajectory generation, Hydra CLI syntax errors, a configuration bug causing experiments to run on the wrong dataset (GPQA instead of MATH), and initial experiments using an outdated set of paraphrasing strategies (v2.1 instead of v4).",
  "primary_success": "Systematically investigated paraphrase strategy effectiveness for sandbagging detection, discovering that the optimal strategy is dataset-dependent (eval-like for USACO, casual for GPQA, mixed for MATH) and that v4 eval-like strategies provided a significant detection boost on USACO.",
  "brief_summary": "A deep research session investigating optimal paraphrase strategies for sandbagging detection. Claude designed and executed a series of experiments across USACO, GPQA, and MATH datasets, overcoming numerous technical hurdles like API timeouts and configuration bugs. The key finding was that the best strategy is dataset-dependent, with 'eval-like' strategies performing best on USACO, 'casual' on GPQA, and a mix on MATH.",
