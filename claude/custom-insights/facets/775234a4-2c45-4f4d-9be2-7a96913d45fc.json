  "friction_detail": "The implementation had a few minor issues: Claude initially used an old color palette, the default theme logic was overridden by localStorage, the navbar color was hardcoded, and a webpack alias was missing. All issues were quickly fixed with user feedback.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully designed and implemented a sophisticated, multi-theme system with a context provider, custom hook, and a theme toggle component that intelligently switches between a simple light/dark toggle in production and a full dropdown with 8 themes in development.",
  "brief_summary": "The user requested an Anthropic-style theme for their portfolio. Claude planned and implemented a comprehensive theme switcher with 8 variants, using a React Context and CSS variables. After several iterations to fix minor bugs (wrong colors, hardcoded navbar) and refine the UX (changing from a full dropdown to a simple light/dark toggle for production), the feature was successfully completed and is production-ready.",
