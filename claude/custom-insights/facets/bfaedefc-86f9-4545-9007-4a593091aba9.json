  "friction_detail": "Agent initially implemented extensions as mutually exclusive and had to be corrected. Parallel tests overwrote each other's logs, requiring re-runs. The smaller test model (gpt-4.1-nano) was not capable enough for some complex workflows, which caused test failures that needed to be re-run with a more capable model (gpt-4o).",
  "primary_success": "Successfully managed a complex, multi-file feature implementation from planning through debugging and testing, including adapting to significant design changes mid-flight and fixing a final output bug.",
  "brief_summary": "The agent implemented a complex multi-dimensional scheming evaluation feature based on a spec. It involved a detailed planning phase, handling user-driven design changes (e.g., making extensions combinable), extensive parallel testing, debugging issues caused by model capabilities, and finally fixing the JSON output to include the new extension metrics.",
