  "brief_summary": "A user was confused when their script reported 10 selected prompts, but the report file they viewed only contained 2. Claude investigated and found a bug where two different parts of the code were generating the report filename with inconsistent logic. Claude fixed the bug to use a single source of truth for the path and archived the old, confusingly-named files.",
