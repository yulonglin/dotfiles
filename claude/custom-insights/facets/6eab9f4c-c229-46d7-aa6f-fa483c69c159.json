  "primary_success": "Successfully updated a Python plotting script to calculate and display 95% Wilson CI error bars on all figures in the research report.",
  "brief_summary": "User wanted 95% CI error bars added to a LaTeX research report. Claude first misunderstood and added CIs to the text, but after the user clarified it should be in figures, Claude modified the plotting script, fixed a calculation bug, regenerated all plots with error bars, and recompiled the final PDF.",
