  "brief_summary": "The user asked to address the `metrics.md` spec. Claude cleaned it up to become a canonical source of truth, defining primary metrics and setting more practical `k` values for sampling (1-20 instead of 1-100). It also added example commands and refactored a reference document to point to the new, cleaned-up metrics spec.",
