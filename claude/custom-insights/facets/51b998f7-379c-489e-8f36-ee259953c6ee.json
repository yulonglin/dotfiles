  "friction_detail": "The session was dominated by permission issues on RunPod stemming from files being owned by `root` instead of the user. This manifested as Claude Code OAuth errors, `npm` EACCES errors, and `apt` lock file errors. The assistant also initially over-engineered a solution before being guided to a simpler fix by the user.",
  "primary_success": "Correctly diagnosed that multiple permission errors on a RunPod instance were caused by files being owned by `root` and guided the user to fix the issue, ultimately improving the cloud setup scripts to prevent the problem in the future.",
  "brief_summary": "The user reported a permission error on RunPod. The assistant diagnosed that files were owned by `root`, causing issues with Claude Code, npm, and apt. After some initial over-engineering and course-correction from the user, the assistant helped update the cloud setup scripts to correctly handle user creation and file ownership, providing a robust long-term fix.",
