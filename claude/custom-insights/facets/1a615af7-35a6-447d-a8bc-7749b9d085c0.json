  "friction_detail": "A git merge conflict with an upstream Overleaf change occurred, which Claude had to analyze and resolve before continuing.",
  "primary_success": "Claude successfully refactored a major section of a research paper based on a high-level list of 'insights' from the user. This involved restructuring subsection titles and content, moving a key finding from the 'Limitations' section into 'Results', and correctly handling a git merge conflict during the process.",
  "brief_summary": "The user proposed restructuring the paper's Results section around a list of key 'insights'. Claude analyzed the proposal, drafted a new structure, and, after user approval, implemented the large-scale refactoring of the LaTeX source. This involved renaming all results subsections, moving content between sections, and resolving a git merge conflict from an external collaborator's changes before committing.",
