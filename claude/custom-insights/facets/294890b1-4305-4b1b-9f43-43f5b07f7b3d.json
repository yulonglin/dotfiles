  "friction_detail": "The assistant initially misunderstood the user's C\u00b3 consistency goal, focusing on paraphrase equivalence instead of contextual realism, but corrected its approach after user feedback.",
  "primary_success": "Analyzed a complex set of research artifacts (paraphrasing prompts), synthesized the findings, and created a detailed, multi-stage implementation plan for a data processing pipeline based on user requirements for Vendi score and answerability.",
  "brief_summary": "The user wanted to select a diverse set of paraphrasing prompts. The assistant analyzed existing prompts for realism, and after discussion, created a comprehensive plan to build a new pipeline. This pipeline would use answerability and Vendi score to select the top 10 most diverse and effective strategies. The session concluded with the completion of this plan.",
