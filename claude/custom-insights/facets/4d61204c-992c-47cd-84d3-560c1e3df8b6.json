  "friction_detail": "The `sync_secrets` script initially failed with a non-zero exit code due to `set -e` combined with a function returning 1 when files were already in sync. Claude had to debug and remove the `-e` flag from the script's shebang.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully debugged the `set -e` issue in the new `sync-secrets` shell script by tracing the exit codes of the sourced functions.",
  "brief_summary": "The user first asked to clean up and synchronize their `authorized_keys` file. Claude performed the cleanup, then created a `sync-secrets` wrapper script and alias for easier manual syncs. The agent debugged an issue with `set -e` in the new script and finally committed all the changes in logical commits.",
