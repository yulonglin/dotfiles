  "friction_detail": "Claude's initial hypotheses for the detector confound (e.g., 'model voice') were incorrect as they failed to account for the binary nature of the classifier's input. The user had to correct this reasoning to steer the investigation toward the true root cause.",
  "primary_success": "After being corrected by the user, successfully performed a deep root cause analysis, identifying that the lie detector's failure was due to massive baseline differences in probe responses between models and a mismatch between the training task (factual lying) and the test task (sandbagging).",
  "brief_summary": "The session began as an inquiry into whether evasion prompts target lie detector signals. Through an iterative process of analysis and user correction, it evolved into a deep investigation that uncovered a critical confound: the lie detector was detecting model identity, not sandbagging. The root causes\u2014large baseline differences in probe responses between models and a mismatch between 'factual lying' and 'sandbagging'\u2014were identified and documented.",
