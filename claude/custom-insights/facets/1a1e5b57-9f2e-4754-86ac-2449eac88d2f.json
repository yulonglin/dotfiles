  "friction_detail": "Claude initially suggested it could be instructed to programmatically run /compact, but then correctly realized this was not possible and that only a user can invoke it. This led to refining the proposed solution.",
  "primary_success": "Claude correctly diagnosed a complex performance issue (concurrency conflicts + context bloat), proposed a robust 'sequential agent' pattern as a solution, and then implemented this pattern as a new, resumable /bulk-edit skill.",
  "brief_summary": "User reported a separate Claude session was extremely slow while applying many edits to a file. Together, they diagnosed the root cause as a combination of concurrent agent edits causing conflicts and massive context bloat. They developed a new 'sequential agent' pattern for bulk edits, which Claude implemented as a reusable /bulk-edit skill and also updated the global CLAUDE.md with new rules to prevent the issue from recurring.",
