  "brief_summary": "Following user feedback, Claude further refined a research paper. It added new figures illustrating different sandbagging variants, strengthened the textual discussion of a key confound in a baseline method, and strategically placed new content in either the main body or appendix to stay within the 12-page limit. The final, updated paper was successfully compiled.",
