  "friction_detail": "The main friction was incorrect experimental results caused by two bugs: 1) The default `--invalid-response-handling skip` was silently dropping most of the data. 2) The lie detector variant generation was using a fragile global index counter instead of a per-question probe index. Both had to be diagnosed and fixed.",
  "primary_success": "Diagnosing that `invalid-response-handling=skip` was the root cause of 99% of samples being dropped, and then fixing the lie detector variant generation logic to use robust per-question indices.",
  "brief_summary": "The user asked to verify v4.1 prompt detection results across USACO, GPQA, and MATH. The process turned into a deep debugging session where Claude discovered that the classifier was silently dropping 99% of data due to invalid response handling. After fixing this and another bug in the data generation logic, Claude successfully ran all experiments and confirmed that lie detectors are systematically defeated across all datasets.",
