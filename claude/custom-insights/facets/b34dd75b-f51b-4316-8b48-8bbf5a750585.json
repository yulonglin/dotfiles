  "friction_detail": "The gpt-5-nano experiment runs consistently failed with `APIConnectionError`. Claude systematically debugged the issue, ruling out the API key, network connectivity, and Docker sandbox before isolating the root cause: the `max_connections` setting in the `run_sweep` script was too high, causing timeouts. Reducing it from 100 to 10 resolved the issue.",
  "primary_success": "Systematically debugged a persistent API connection error, isolating the root cause to an overly high `max_connections` setting in a script, and successfully launched the requested experiments.",
  "brief_summary": "User asked to run an experiment from a spec file. The experiment runs repeatedly failed with API connection errors. Claude conducted a systematic debugging process, testing the API key, network, and various components in isolation, eventually identifying that the `max_connections` setting was too high. After fixing the configuration, the experiments were successfully launched.",
