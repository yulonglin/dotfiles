  "friction_detail": "The assistant initially tried to read the large/binary eval file directly, then correctly switched to using analysis scripts to inspect the proprietary format.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully analyzed a complex binary evaluation file, identified pervasive but inconsistent explicit sandbagging reasoning, and provided a detailed, structured report quantifying the behavior and its relation to paraphrase strategies.",
  "brief_summary": "The user asked Claude to analyze a GSM8K evaluation file to understand model sandbagging. Claude correctly identified the proprietary file format, extracted samples of correct and incorrect answers, and discovered that the model explicitly reasons about sandbagging in most cases but is inconsistent in its actions. The session concluded with a comprehensive summary of findings.",
