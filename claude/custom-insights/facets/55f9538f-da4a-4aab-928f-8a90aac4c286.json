  "friction_detail": "There was a point of confusion where the user could not see the file updates Claude had made, likely due to a stale dev server. Claude had to re-verify the changes and suggest a fix to the user.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully restructured a presentation based on a high-level spec, and then dynamically incorporated user feedback from a conversation to add a new 'Risks' slide, demonstrating strong interactive refinement.",
  "brief_summary": "The user requested updates to the Week 20 slides based on a spec file. Claude restructured the presentation to focus on the ICML roadmap, condensing technical details. After a discussion where the user raised a concern about experimental risks, Claude incorporated that risk into a new slide. Despite a brief hiccup where the user couldn't see the file changes, the slides were successfully updated to meet all requirements.",
