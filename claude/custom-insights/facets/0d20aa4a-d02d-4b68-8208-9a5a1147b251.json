  "brief_summary": "The user asked about statistical reporting standards. Claude found mentions of CIs but confirmed there was no standardized methodology. The user provided a detailed standard, and after discussion, Claude created a canonical `ci-standards.md` document and refactored multiple agent files and checklists to reference this single source of truth, ensuring the new standard was applied consistently.",
