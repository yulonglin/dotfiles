  "friction_detail": "The main friction was a Slidev parser bug where '---' inside HTML comments broke rendering. The agent first tried removing comments, then replacing '---' with '~~~', before arriving at the correct solution (commenting content and dividers separately) with user guidance. There were also issues with image paths during PDF export from a subdirectory.",
  "primary_success": "Correctly diagnosed a non-obvious Slidev parser bug and, through iteration with the user, implemented a robust fix and documented it as a best practice in CLAUDE.md and a new skill.",
  "brief_summary": "A long debugging session to fix a Slidev presentation. The agent diagnosed that '---' inside HTML comments was breaking the parser, and after several attempts, implemented a pattern of commenting content and dividers separately. This solution was then documented in project files and a new global skill.",
