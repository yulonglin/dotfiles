  "friction_detail": "A code-reviewer agent found a critical bug in the initial refactoring of the few-shot logic. Later, another review revealed one task file (`bigcodebench.py`) was missed during the mass migration. Both issues were successfully fixed.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully executed a large-scale, cross-cutting refactoring of the project's core data splitting logic, migrating ~15 files and all related configurations to a new dev/test convention while ensuring data integrity and fixing bugs identified during the process.",
  "brief_summary": "The user requested to refactor the data splitting logic from a 3-way (train/val/test) to a 2-way (dev/test) split. The assistant, guided by a code-reviewer agent's advice, implemented the new logic in a core utility and then systematically migrated all 15 task files. After fixing a few bugs caught during reviews, the assistant verified the new system works correctly, completing the large-scale refactoring.",
