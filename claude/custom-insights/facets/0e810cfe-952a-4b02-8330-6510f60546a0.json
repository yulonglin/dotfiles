  "friction_detail": "Claude initially focused on symptoms like batch size and cache settings, implementing several code changes that didn't solve the underlying resource limit and process model issues. The core problem was only found after checking the git history late in the process.",
  "primary_success": "Claude successfully diagnosed two intertwined root causes: the OS file descriptor limit being too low for the number of parallel tasks, and a recent refactoring that removed subprocess isolation which previously prevented this issue. Providing the correct `ulimit` command was the key action.",
  "brief_summary": "The user's script failed due to \"Too many open files\" and SQLite errors. Claude first identified a Google Drive path issue, which the user fixed. When the error persisted, Claude iteratively debugged, trying smaller batches and different cache policies, before digging into the git history to find the true root causes: a recent refactor had removed subprocess isolation, and the sheer number of evaluations (multiplied by a new `epochs` parameter) was exhausting the default OS file descriptor limit. The session concluded with Claude providing the correct `ulimit` command to resolve the issue.",
