  "friction_detail": "Subagents exploring other repositories via an external API were extremely slow, hindering the comparison task. The agent had to proceed with incomplete information from those explorations.",
  "primary_success": "Managed a complex workflow involving multi-repo exploration, code review, fixing critical bugs (race conditions and hash collisions), and committing the fix, all while handling friction from slow external tools.",
  "brief_summary": "The user wanted to compare concurrency strategies across several repos. Despite slow external tools hindering the exploration, the agent provided a comparison, which led to a code review of the current repo. The review found critical race condition and hash collision bugs, which the agent then fixed, committed, and pushed, ultimately improving the repository's robustness.",
