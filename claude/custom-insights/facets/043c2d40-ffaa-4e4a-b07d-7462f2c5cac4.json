  "friction_detail": "Initial experiments failed due to API connection errors, requiring the addition of retry logic to the paraphraser. There was also significant confusion caused by outdated and conflicting documentation regarding the correct lie detector classifiers to use, which required multiple rounds of investigation to resolve.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully navigated complex, outdated, and conflicting documentation to identify the correct lie detector classifier models and created all 12 necessary configuration files to run the ICML baseline experiments, fixing a critical blocker.",
  "brief_summary": "The user initiated a series of AI safety experiments and immediately hit configuration and API connection errors. The assistant fixed a broken dataset config, implemented crucial retry logic to solve network failures, and then navigated a maze of conflicting documentation to identify the correct, up-to-date lie detector classifiers, ultimately creating all necessary configuration files for the primary research task.",
