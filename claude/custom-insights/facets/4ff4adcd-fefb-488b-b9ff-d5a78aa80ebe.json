  "friction_detail": "Minor communication hiccup where Claude misunderstood whether the user wanted to personally update the paper or wanted Claude to do it. This was quickly clarified.",
  "primary_success": "Performed a deep, critical review of a technical spec, identifying significant gaps in statistical rigor and stealth checks. Then, collaboratively with the user, redesigned the pipeline to be more robust (e.g., two-stage filtering), implemented the required 'strategy leakage' detector, and updated both the spec and the research paper.",
  "brief_summary": "The user asked for a review of a prompt selection pipeline spec. Claude identified critical design flaws, proposed a more robust two-stage filtering approach, and discussed the trade-offs of different implementation choices. After refining the spec, Claude implemented a required keyword-based 'strategy leakage' detector and updated the research paper's methodology section to reflect the improved pipeline design.",
