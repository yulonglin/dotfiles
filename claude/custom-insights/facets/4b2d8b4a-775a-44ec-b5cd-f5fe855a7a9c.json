  "friction_detail": "The session involved multiple corrections: Claude initially replaced a required method (TM) instead of adding a new one, used incorrect SEM values from the source data which turned out to be standard deviations, used the wrong variant of a baseline method before being corrected, and needed font sizes adjusted on the final plots.",
  "primary_success": "Claude managed a highly complex and iterative task of regenerating multiple publication-quality figures, correctly diagnosing and fixing a subtle data issue (SEM vs std dev), incorporating multiple user corrections on method choice and styling, and updating all relevant LaTeX and script files.",
  "brief_summary": "The user requested a complete overhaul of the GPQA figures in a research paper using new data. The session involved a lengthy iterative process where Claude created a new plotting script, generated new figures, and responded to numerous user corrections regarding which methods to include, which baseline variant to use, and how to style the plots. Claude also diagnosed an issue where SEM values in the new data were incorrect, leading to a fix. The final, corrected figures and LaTeX were committed.",
