  "friction_detail": "The two parallel subagents spawned to implement the structural and semantic metrics got stuck in a loop, repeatedly failing to write files to disk. Claude had to kill the agents and create the files manually.",
  "primary_success": "Researched and proposed a superior semantic analysis method for code-based sandbagging detection, implemented both the original and new methods, and discovered that the detection signal was inverted from the original hypothesis, providing a key insight into the model's behavior.",
  "brief_summary": "User asked to improve a code-metrics detection method. Claude researched superior semantic analysis techniques, updated the plan, and attempted to implement it with parallel agents. The agents failed, so Claude took over, created all necessary files, ran the analysis, and discovered the signal was inverted (low variance indicated sandbagging). It then documented these negative but important findings.",
