  "friction_detail": "Claude's first attempt at generating the paper from the plan resulted in a draft that was only 2.5 pages, significantly under the 4-page target.",
  "primary_success": "After the initial generated paper was too short, Claude successfully orchestrated a multi-agent critique (using Gemini, Codex, and a Plan agent) to analyze the failure and produce a much stronger, more detailed plan for the next attempt.",
  "brief_summary": "Claude created a LaTeX paper from a plan, but the result was too short (2.5 pages). The user then asked for a re-plan, which Claude executed by gathering critiques from three different AI agents and synthesizing their feedback into a new, more robust plan for expanding the paper.",
