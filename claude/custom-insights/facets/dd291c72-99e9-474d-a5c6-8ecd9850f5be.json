  },
  "friction_detail": "The main friction was a recurring sandbox permission error (`mkdir '/run'`) that required several workarounds. There was also a minor issue where a generated report overwrote a previous one, which had to be corrected.",
  "primary_success": "Acting on the user's insight, Claude successfully performed a major refactoring to add \"task refusal\" as a key metric to the pipeline, significantly improving the rigor of the research tooling. The subsequent parallelization of the script was also a major success, reducing runtime from hours to minutes.",
  "brief_summary": "The user initiated a re-run of a prompt selection pipeline, which uncovered a series of issues and opportunities for improvement. Together, they worked through a persistent sandbox permission error, added a critical \"task refusal\" metric which required a major refactoring of the code and paper, validated the new metric's heuristic, and finally parallelized the entire pipeline to drastically reduce runtime. The session concluded with all evaluations completed for two models across two datasets and a plan for the next feature.",
