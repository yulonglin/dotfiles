  "brief_summary": "The user asked how `answer_count` was computed for MATH. The agent discovered the implementation was bugged, as it only extracted MCQ letters and would fail for numerical answers. The agent then implemented a fix to use the correct answer extraction function, updated tests and documentation, and committed the changes.",
