  "brief_summary": "The user requested to find and analyze the V4.1 stealth prompts. Claude located the 6 prompt files, read them, and produced a detailed analysis of each evasion strategy (e.g., 'Genuine Limitation', 'Cognitive Blindspot'). It summarized the core insight that all strategies work by manipulating the model's self-perception to make it answer probes honestly but from a distorted viewpoint.",
