  "friction_detail": "The script development involved several small issues: an incorrect rsync flag (`--contimeout`), flawed logic for detecting skipped files that was then corrected, and multiple failed attempts to parse the script's own help text before landing on a working awk command.",
  "primary_success": "Claude successfully built a robust `transfer` script, iteratively incorporating user feedback for features like no-clobber-by-default, automatic renaming, informative progress logs, and clear help text, while also debugging its own implementation errors.",
  "brief_summary": "The user requested a script to simplify file transfers with a server. Claude created an initial version and then iteratively refined it based on user feedback, adding features like separate `download`/`upload` commands, progress bars, and warnings for skipped files. After debugging a few issues, including an incorrect rsync flag and a tricky help-text parser, the final script was committed and pushed.",
