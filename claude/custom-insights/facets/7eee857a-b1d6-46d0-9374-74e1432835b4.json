  "friction_detail": "A simple commit task was blocked by a sandbox restriction on `.claude/settings.local.json`. Claude's initial attempts to create a PR and then merge were blocked, requiring a different approach like stashing.",
  "primary_success": "Claude brilliantly diagnosed a complex interaction between git and the sandbox, explaining exactly why `git stash` was partially failing (write to deny-listed file was blocked). It then successfully used a stash/merge/push workflow to resolve the situation, demonstrating deep debugging skill.",
  "brief_summary": "The user asked to commit and push changes, but a sandbox restriction on a local settings file blocked git operations. Claude first tried creating a PR, then a direct merge, both of which failed. It correctly diagnosed the sandbox issue, tried `git stash` as a workaround, and after some difficulty, successfully merged the changes to main and cleaned up the temporary branch. The session was a masterclass in debugging git/sandbox interactions.",
