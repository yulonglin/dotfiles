  "friction_detail": "Claude's initial attempt at a simplified list format was too lossy and omitted important details from the user's original input, requiring a correction. There was also a pre-existing build error that caused some confusion, though it wasn't Claude's fault.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully iterated from a raw list of items into a polished, well-formatted 'Things' page that matched the user's desired style, including adding links and handling user feedback on tone and content separation.",
  "brief_summary": "The user provided a list of recommended products and tools. Claude created a new page on the user's Gatsby site, initially as a standard blog post, then iteratively refined it into a simpler, linked-list format inspired by examples provided by the user. The session involved multiple rounds of content additions, formatting changes, and debugging a pre-existing build issue.",
