  "brief_summary": "The user asked for data on paraphrase answerability. The agent investigated quality reports and source code to provide current answerability rates for GPQA, MATH, and USACO datasets (91.3% for USACO). It also detailed the specific criteria used for measuring answerability and correctly concluded that no historical baseline for USACO was documented.",
