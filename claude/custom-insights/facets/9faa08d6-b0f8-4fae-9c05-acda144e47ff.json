  "primary_success": "Claude correctly diagnosed how `max_tasks` and `max_connections` interacted in the `inspect_eval` call, clarifying that the connection pool was shared and preventing the user from misinterpreting the parallel execution.",
  "brief_summary": "The user was concerned about a batch evaluation script making too many parallel connections. Claude investigated the code, explained that the connection pool was shared across parallel tasks, and clarified the performance trade-offs. Claude then adjusted the connection limit as requested and showed the user where to find and monitor the output logs.",
