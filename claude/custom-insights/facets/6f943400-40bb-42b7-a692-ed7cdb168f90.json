  "friction_detail": "Claude was blocked by its own safety policy from running the destructive `git reset --hard` command and had to instruct the user to run it manually. This is a desirable friction.",
  "primary_success": "Executing a safe and reversible workflow to discard local changes. This involved creating a backup branch, stashing uncommitted changes, committing the stash to the backup branch for a complete snapshot, and clearly explaining the implications of the final `git reset --hard` command to the user.",
  "brief_summary": "The user needed to sync a diverged git branch, preferring the remote's working code over their local non-working changes. Claude devised a safe plan by creating a backup branch and stashing local work, then committing the stash to the backup for a complete snapshot. It explained the `git reset --hard` command and, due to safety constraints, instructed the user to run it manually to complete the sync.",
