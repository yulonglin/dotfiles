  "friction_detail": "One of the parallel experiment runs failed to generate its final 'summary.json' file. Claude worked around this by manually computing the necessary statistics directly from the raw transcript logs for that run.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully orchestrated a complex series of parallel AI safety evaluations using tmux, analyzed results from multiple distinct experimental conditions (including a critical finding on the 'Escalation' extension), and synthesized them into a comprehensive, multi-page LaTeX research report with plots.",
  "brief_summary": "User initiated a large-scale AI safety evaluation, asking Claude to run multiple parallel experiments with different 'extensions'. Claude used tmux to manage the runs, collected and analyzed data from ~900 samples across 6 conditions, handled a failed run by manually computing stats, and produced a final 7-page PDF report detailing the key finding: that providing an escalation path dramatically reduced risky model behavior.",
