  "friction_detail": "The core friction was a persistent \"plan mode\" bug that auto-denied file write permissions to the background agents. This required a complex and slow workaround where new agents had to be spawned to parse the output logs of the failed agents to recover the content that should have been written.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully working around the severe \"plan mode\" write-blocking bug by launching a second layer of \"extraction\" agents to parse the output transcripts of the failed agents and recover the generated content.",
  "brief_summary": "The user requested detailed agent specs for the top 3 hackathon projects. The spec-writing agents were repeatedly blocked from writing files by a persistent \"plan mode\" bug. Claude successfully worked around this issue by launching a second set of agents to parse the output logs of the failed agents, extract the generated content, and write it to the correct files, ultimately producing all three requested specs.",
