  "brief_summary": "The user requested that the GitHub CLI (`gh`) be installed and logged into by default. The agent added a helper function to `install.sh` that handles installation on both Linux (using `apt` with a fallback to a direct download) and macOS (using `brew`). The change also included a step to run `gh auth login` to simplify authentication on new machines.",
