  "friction_detail": "The plotting script initially failed to display error bars because of a data parsing bug where the Standard Error of the Mean (SEM) values were being read as zero.",
  "primary_success": "Claude diagnosed and fixed a subtle data parsing bug in the plotting script that was causing error bars to be invisible, then engaged in a nuanced discussion about statistical methodology and winner determination.",
  "brief_summary": "The user requested to merge two overlapping figures and add error bars. Claude merged them, but then had to debug why the error bars were invisible, eventually finding and fixing a data parsing bug in the plotting script. This led to a productive discussion about the wide error bars and the correct statistical interpretation, resulting in an updated and more accurate figure.",
