  "brief_summary": "The user reported the Serena dashboard was auto-opening. Claude activated its systematic debugging skill, methodically investigated potential causes, and correctly identified that Serena's MCP server was starting a local dashboard. It then found the correct CLI flag (`--open-web-dashboard`) to disable the behavior and created a detailed implementation plan.",
