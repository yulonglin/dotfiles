  "brief_summary": "Claude conducted an in-depth interview using the `/spec-interview` skill to understand the user's difficulty waking up. It identified key factors like inconsistent medication timing and the failure of low-accountability systems. The session resulted in a detailed, phased implementation plan focusing on consistent habits and a simple, actionable tracking system.",
