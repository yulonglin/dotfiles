  "primary_success": "Spawning specialist agents (`tooling-engineer`, `code-reviewer`) to analyze the trade-offs of cache standardization, and then using their output to identify three critical, non-obvious thread-safety bugs and race conditions, which were then fixed.",
  "brief_summary": "The user's query about cache locations led to a deep analysis. Claude, assisted by sub-agents, compared various caching implementations, which advised against unification but discovered three critical thread-safety race conditions. Claude fixed the bugs, and then standardized the hashing algorithm across caches to SHA-256.",
