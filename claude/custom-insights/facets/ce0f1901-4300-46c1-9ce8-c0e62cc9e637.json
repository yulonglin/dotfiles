  "friction_detail": "Claude initially missed the nested `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` during the directory rename but noticed the discrepancy and corrected its understanding of the plugin structure.",
  "primary_success": "Claude successfully executed a multi-step plan involving directory renaming, file creation, and file modification across several locations, and correctly identified a manual follow-up step for the user (re-installing the plugin to update the cache).",
  "brief_summary": "Following a design session, the user asked Claude to implement the plan to create a `codex-cli` skill. This involved renaming the `code-quality` plugin to `code-toolkit`, creating the new skill file within it, and updating the `gemini-cli` agent with a shared naming convention. Claude executed the plan, self-corrected on a missed file, and finished by noting the user would need to reinstall the plugin.",
