  "brief_summary": "The user asked Claude to create a 'Week 20' slide deck using the 'research-presentation' skill. Claude first generated the slides, then proactively critiqued its own work for redundancy, weak narrative, and use of tables over charts. It then rewrote the slides, reducing the count from 22 to 15, improving the narrative, and ensuring they followed the presentation best practices.",
