  "brief_summary": "The user was concerned that \"sandbagging refusal\" was missing from their paper. Claude investigated and found it was mentioned in the appendix, and clarified the important distinction between \"sandbag refusal\" and \"task refusal.\" After a brief discussion, the user decided it should be mentioned in the main text, so Claude drafted and applied a clarifying sentence to the paper, which was then committed.",
