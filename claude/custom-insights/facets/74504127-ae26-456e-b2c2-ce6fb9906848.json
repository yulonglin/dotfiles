  "primary_success": "Clearly explained the statistical underpinnings of the lie detector's signals (coefficients, zeroed analysis) and added them as appendix slides to a presentation.",
  "brief_summary": "The user asked for clarification on previous findings about lie detectors relying on 'confessions'. The agent detailed which models' detectors were confession-based, analyzed the 'combined' model's signals, and then, at the user's request, added several appendix slides to a presentation explaining the statistical concepts for a wider audience.",
