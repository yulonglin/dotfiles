  "primary_success": "Executed a complex, multi-model brainstorming pipeline and synthesized the outputs into a clear, prioritized list of 5 concrete research ideas, complete with hypotheses, methods, and kill conditions. The summary of convergent insights was particularly valuable.",
  "brief_summary": "The user initiated a brainstorming session on detecting sandbagging models. The agent ran a full pipeline using 8 different LLMs, which included divergence, red-teaming, and synthesis phases. The result was a prioritized list of five concrete detection methods, a summary of key insights, and a list of deprioritized ideas.",
