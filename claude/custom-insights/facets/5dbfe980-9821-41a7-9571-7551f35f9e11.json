  "brief_summary": "The user wanted to add new sandbagging prompts from a synthesis document. Claude first engaged in a brainstorming session to define a new, more meaningful organizational structure for all prompts based on strategic themes (e.g., 'persona', 'process_sabotage', 'incentive_based'). After refining the structure with the user, Claude created a detailed plan for migrating existing prompts and adding the new ones.",
