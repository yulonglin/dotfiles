  "brief_summary": "The user reported that a transcript enhancer was incorrectly responding to questions in the text. Claude diagnosed the issue as weak prompt instructions. The agent implemented a fix by restructuring the prompt with XML tags for clarity and adding a strong 'final instruction' at the end of the prompt to leverage the LLM's recency bias, successfully preventing the conversational behavior.",
