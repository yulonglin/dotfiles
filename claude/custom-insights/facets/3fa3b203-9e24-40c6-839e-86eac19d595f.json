  "friction_detail": "The design process required several iterations. Initial plans for data digests and a mandatory skill were rejected by the user in favor of full transcripts and a standalone script. Claude also had to revise its understanding of how the built-in /insights command worked, discovering it used a two-phase (aggregate + deep analysis) process.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully guided an iterative design process, adapting to user feedback and technical discoveries to produce a robust plan for a custom analytics tool using Gemini CLI for large-scale processing.",
  "brief_summary": "The user wanted to replace the biased /insights command. Through an iterative design conversation, Claude and the user evolved a plan from a simple wrapper to a full-fledged analytics pipeline. The final plan specifies a standalone Python script using the Gemini CLI to process full transcripts of all ~956 sessions, with caching and an optional, zero-cost skill wrapper.",
