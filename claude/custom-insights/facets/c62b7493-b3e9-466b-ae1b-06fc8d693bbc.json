  "brief_summary": "The user wanted a single command to build and serve their Gatsby site. Claude added a `preview` script to `package.json`, then correctly explained to the user that `bun run` doesn't speed up Gatsby's Node.js-based build process. Finally, Claude documented the new `bun dev` and `bun preview` commands in `CLAUDE.md`.",
