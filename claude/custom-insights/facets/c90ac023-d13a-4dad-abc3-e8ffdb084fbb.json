  "primary_success": "The strategic revision process: first, cutting aggressively to sharpen the narrative based on a detailed critique, and then, when the paper was too short, intelligently adding back the most impactful content to perfectly meet the 4-page limit.",
  "brief_summary": "To prepare a workshop paper for an award, Claude first performed a detailed critique and then executed a major revision to sharpen its narrative. This made the paper too short, so Claude strategically re-introduced key sections to meet the 4-page limit. The session concluded with several fine-tuning iterations on figure layout and wording to produce a polished, submission-ready draft.",
