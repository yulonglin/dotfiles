  "friction_detail": "The session was extremely long, requiring context compaction to continue. The agent also got sidetracked by suggesting new status emojis from a 'bulk-edit' skill instead of just finishing the original task, but eventually got back on track.",
  "primary_success": "Despite the long and complex task, Claude systematically worked through all 66 comments, checked them against the paper, and successfully updated the status of each one in the tracking file as requested.",
  "brief_summary": "The user asked Claude to check a 66-item list of reviewer comments against a paper and mark them as addressed. Over a long, iterative session that required context compaction, Claude systematically checked each comment, updated the tracking file with the correct status (\u2705, \u2796, \u23f3, \u26a0\ufe0f), and provided a final summary of remaining work items.",
