  "friction_detail": "User was initially confused by Claude changing default CSS variable colors, requiring an explanation. The implementation also hit multiple build errors (import issues, JSX transpilation) and introduced a new visual bug (image overlay), all of which Claude had to debug and fix.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully debugged and resolved three consecutive, distinct problems encountered during implementation: a build failure due to CJS/ESM mix, a second build failure due to untranspiled JSX in an SSR file, and a visual regression where a CSS overlay hid an image.",
  "brief_summary": "User provided a plan to fix a FOUC. Claude implemented it, pausing to explain a step when the user questioned it. It then expertly debugged multiple subsequent build errors and a visual regression caused by the changes, ultimately fixing everything and committing the final work.",
