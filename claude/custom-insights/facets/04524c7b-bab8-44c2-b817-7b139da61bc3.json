  "friction_detail": "A persistent `APIConnectionError` from the OpenAI gpt-5-nano endpoint caused numerous failed runs. The root cause was hard to diagnose, initially attributed to concurrency, caching, or rate limits before being correctly identified as a combination of high default `reasoning_effort` on the model causing timeouts, and a user-side VPN exacerbating connection instability.",
  "primary_success": "Diagnosing the complex, persistent `APIConnectionError` by methodically eliminating variables (caching, concurrency, timeouts, VPN) and finally discovering the `reasoning_effort: minimal` setting as the key to stabilizing the OpenAI Responses API.",
  "brief_summary": "The user wanted to generate baseline behavioral probe results and then engineer more evasive prompts. This led to a massive debugging session to solve persistent `APIConnectionError`s with `gpt-5-nano`. After investigating caching, concurrency, timeouts, and VPN issues, Claude finally diagnosed the root cause as the model's default `reasoning_effort` and successfully fixed it, allowing the experiments to complete.",
