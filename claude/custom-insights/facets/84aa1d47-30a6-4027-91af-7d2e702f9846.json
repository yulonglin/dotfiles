  "friction_detail": "Initial parallel execution of the pipeline across three datasets caused API timeouts, requiring a switch to sequential execution. The assistant also initially misunderstood the user's C\u00b3 consistency goal, focusing on paraphrase equivalence instead of contextual realism. A data loading issue with the USACO dataset also required debugging.",
  "primary_success": "Designed and fully implemented a complex, multi-stage data processing pipeline (the Paraphrasing Strategy Selection Pipeline) from a high-level user request, including planning, coding, testing, and debugging.",
  "brief_summary": "The user wanted to select a diverse set of paraphrasing prompts for sandbagging detection experiments. The assistant first analyzed existing prompts for realism, then designed and implemented a full pipeline to filter and select the top-10 most diverse and answerable strategies using Vendi score. After debugging data loading and execution issues, the pipeline was successfully run for GPQA, MATH, and USACO datasets.",
