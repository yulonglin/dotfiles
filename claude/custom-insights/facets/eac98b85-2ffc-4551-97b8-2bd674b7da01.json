  "friction_detail": "Claude initially marked baselines as primary for all work, but the user clarified they were only primary for the 'trusted monitoring' sub-task, requiring a documentation correction.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully traced the provenance of the 'UK AISI' trusted monitor back to an original Anthropic paper and performed a detailed comparison of the two implementations, enabling an informed decision on which to use as a baseline.",
  "brief_summary": "The user investigated the sandbagging detection trusted monitors used in the lab, tracing the 'UK AISI' monitor back to an Anthropic paper. After a detailed comparison of the two, the user decided to use the Anthropic version as the primary baseline and instructed Claude to update multiple documentation files to reflect this decision and the significant overlap between the two methods.",
