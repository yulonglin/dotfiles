Claude designed and implemented a four-part solution: updating CLAUDE.md guidance, creating a new `/run-experiment` skill for output redirection, adding a `truncate_output.sh` hook for automatic truncation, and registering the hook in `settings.json`. The implementation was refined based on user feedback.",
