  "friction_detail": "The assistant was initially too aggressive in cutting content to meet the page limit, removing some important methodological details that the user later asked to be restored.",
  "primary_success": "Claude performed a highly iterative and precise editing task on a long LaTeX document, making dozens of small cuts across multiple sections, repeatedly recompiling to check page count, and successfully adapting to user feedback to bring the paper from 10.5 pages down to 8 pages.",
  "brief_summary": "The user tasked the assistant with reducing a 10.5-page research paper to 9 pages. Through an iterative process of making targeted LaTeX edits and recompiling, the assistant successfully cut the paper to 8 pages. After the user confirmed the new page count, they instructed the assistant to add back specific, high-value content, for which the assistant then created a new implementation plan.",
