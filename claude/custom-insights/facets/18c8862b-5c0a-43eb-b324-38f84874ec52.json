  "brief_summary": "The user reported that Claude was creating messy file variants (e.g., `report-simple.md`). Claude added a rule to the `CLAUDE.md` file to prevent this. After user feedback, the rule was refined to forbid ambiguous suffixes (`-simple`, `-updated`) while still allowing clear versioning (`-v2`, timestamps).",
