  "brief_summary": "The user asked about creating Anthropic-style plots. The conversation led to Claude obtaining the source for an internal `anthroplot.py` module, correctly advising to use matplotlib for papers, and then designing and implementing a documentation refactor. A `/research-presentation` skill was updated to route users to separate guides for paper figures vs. slides, and all changes were committed.",
