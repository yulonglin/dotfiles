  "friction_detail": "There was an initial misjudgment of the applicability of 'off-by-one' and 'sign-flip' prompts to the USACO dataset. The user's correction prompted a revised analysis that led to a more nuanced and valuable insight about why those specific strategies were undetectable.",
  "primary_success": "Synthesized qualitative prompt scores with quantitative detection results to produce novel insights, particularly the paradox that vague prompts can produce consistent sandbagging behavior and that mechanically consistent strategies can evade inconsistency-based detection (C\u00b3).",
  "brief_summary": "The user requested an analysis of various sandbagging system prompts, scoring them on dimensions like specificity, stealth, and applicability to different datasets (USACO, GPQA, MATH). Claude read the prompts and performance data, generated the scores, and produced several key insights, such as the inverse correlation between stealth and detection, and how the model's default behavior can create consistent sandbagging even from vague prompts.",
