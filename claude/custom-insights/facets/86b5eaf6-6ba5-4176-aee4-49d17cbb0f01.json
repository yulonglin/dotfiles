  "primary_success": "Correctly diagnosed the user's connection issue was a missing binary, provided the build command, and then created excellent, audience-specific documentation in both the user docs and a new CLAUDE.md for developers.",
  "brief_summary": "The user struggled to run a local build of the server. Claude first explained environment variable management, then diagnosed the connection error as a missing binary and provided build instructions. It then significantly improved the project by adding detailed 'build from source' instructions to the user docs and creating a new, comprehensive CLAUDE.md file for developers.",
