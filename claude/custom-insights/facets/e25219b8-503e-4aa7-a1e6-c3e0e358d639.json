  "brief_summary": "The user asked for an analysis of recent changes to a transcript enhancement prompt. Claude detailed the changes, such as adding XML tags and a final anchoring instruction, and explained the prompt engineering principles that justified them, like exploiting the recency effect and providing explicit role-setting. The analysis confirmed the changes were sensible and well-reasoned.",
