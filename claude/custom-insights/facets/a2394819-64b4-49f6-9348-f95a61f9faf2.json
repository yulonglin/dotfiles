  "brief_summary": "The user requested to 'implement the pipeline'. The assistant clarified this meant integrating the existing prompt selection pipeline (which only worked in dry_run mode) with the full evaluation infrastructure. The assistant explored the codebase to understand the necessary connections and produced a detailed implementation plan, but did not execute it.",
