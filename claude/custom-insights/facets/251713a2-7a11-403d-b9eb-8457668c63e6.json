  "friction_detail": "After fixing a bug in SEM calculation, the results were still incorrect. A second, latent path-matching bug was preventing the script from finding the necessary data files; this had to be diagnosed and fixed.",
  "primary_success": "Found and fixed a subtle path-matching bug that was preventing the correct calculation of paired SEM, leading to a significant improvement in statistical accuracy.",
  "brief_summary": "Continuing a debugging session, Claude found a second bug related to file path matching that was causing an SEM calculation fix to fail silently. After fixing this, and confirming the correct statistics, the user provided new requirements from a researcher to adopt a more rigorous CI-based filtering. The session concluded with Claude creating a detailed plan to implement this new methodology.",
