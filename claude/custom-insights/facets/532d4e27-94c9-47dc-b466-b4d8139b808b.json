  "brief_summary": "User asked if the paper reflected a new sandbagging prompt selection strategy. Claude identified that the paper's text was outdated, describing a previous methodology. Through an iterative conversation, Claude gathered the new criteria, updated the main text and appendix of the paper with placeholders, and finally committed the changes at the user's request.",
