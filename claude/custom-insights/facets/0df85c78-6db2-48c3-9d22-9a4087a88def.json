  "friction_detail": "The initial zsh script conversion failed due to a bash-specific syntax for iterating associative array keys (`${\\!array[@]}`). Claude had to debug this and replace it with the zsh equivalent (`${(k)array[@]}`).",
  "primary_success": "Successfully diagnosed and fixed multiple subtle bash-vs-zsh syntax differences during the script refactoring, particularly the associative array key iteration and a variable declaration quirk.",
  "brief_summary": "User initiated the implementation of plans for SSH keepalives and converting deployment scripts to zsh. Claude applied the SSH settings and then refactored the scripts, encountering and fixing several bash-compatibility issues, including a 'bad substitution' error, before committing and pushing the successful refactor.",
