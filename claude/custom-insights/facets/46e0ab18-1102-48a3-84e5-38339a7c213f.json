  "friction_detail": "Claude initially suggested moving CLAUDE.md to a subdirectory, incorrectly stating it would be auto-loaded. It later corrected itself. After the refactoring, the new structure broke the Overleaf build, which required Claude to diagnose the issue and add a `latexmkrc` file as a fix.",
  "primary_success": "Claude successfully diagnosed why the refactored project structure failed on Overleaf and fixed it by creating a `latexmkrc` file to inform Overleaf of the correct paths for build dependencies.",
  "brief_summary": "The user requested a file structure refactor for better Overleaf compatibility. After some discussion and a self-correction on how CLAUDE.md is loaded, Claude moved the main LaTeX file, created a compile script to keep the root directory clean, and moved the project instructions. When the user reported this broke Overleaf, Claude diagnosed the path issue and fixed it by adding and pushing a `latexmkrc` configuration file. It also updated the git remote URL at the user's request.",
