  "friction_detail": "Multiple parallel agents attempted to edit the same LaTeX file concurrently, causing repeated 'file modified since read' errors. The agents had to adapt by re-reading the file or using `sed` commands, which created significant churn and slowed down the process.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully orchestrated 7 parallel agents to address 66 paper review comments, overcoming concurrent file editing conflicts to complete all requested changes and compile the final PDF.",
  "brief_summary": "User requested to address 66 review comments in a LaTeX paper using parallel subagents. Claude launched 7 agents grouped by paper section. The agents encountered significant concurrent file editing conflicts but eventually completed all edits by adapting their strategies (e.g., using `sed`). Claude monitored progress, fixed compilation errors, and provided a final summary of all changes made.",
