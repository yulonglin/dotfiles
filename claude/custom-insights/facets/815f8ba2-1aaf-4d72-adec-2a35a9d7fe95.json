  "friction_detail": "Claude's initial attempt to use \\Statex for unnumbered lines failed because the paper's style file used the older `algorithmic` package, not `algorithmicx`. However, Claude quickly diagnosed this and implemented a clever workaround by defining \\Statex manually in the preamble.",
  "primary_success": "Claude diagnosed a LaTeX package incompatibility (`algorithmic` vs `algorithmicx`) and implemented a clever, non-invasive workaround to add \\Statex functionality, perfectly solving the user's formatting request while respecting the journal's style constraints.",
  "brief_summary": "User wanted to clarify an algorithm in a paper by changing 'median' to 'mean', simplifying a 'quantile' description, and fixing numbered blank lines. Claude implemented the text changes, diagnosed that the LaTeX style file prevented the use of \\Statex for unnumbered lines, and then implemented a workaround to define it manually. After a final user correction to change all 'median' instances, the work was successfully committed.",
