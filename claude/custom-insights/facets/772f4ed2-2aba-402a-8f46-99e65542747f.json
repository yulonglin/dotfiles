  "friction_detail": "A code review identified three critical bugs in the initial implementation related to the `dry_run` mode's safety and reproducibility. These were subsequently fixed. There was also some initial difficulty getting the Hydra CLI configuration to work correctly.",
  "primary_success": "Completed the implementation of a complex, multi-stage data pipeline (Tasks 5-10), including the main runner, CLI, configs, integration tests, and documentation. Also successfully diagnosed and fixed critical bugs identified by a code-reviewer agent.",
  "brief_summary": "The assistant completed the remaining tasks (5-10) for the prompt selection pipeline, building the main runner, CLI, reports, and tests. A code review found critical bugs related to the `dry_run` feature, which the assistant fixed. The session concluded with the pipeline fully implemented and documented, with clear instructions for the user on how to run it and a recommendation to complete the final evaluation integration.",
