  "friction_detail": "Claude initially failed to run tests requiring an API key, not realizing it needed to use `dotenv` to load the key. The user had to provide this guidance.",
  "primary_success": "Conducted a thorough code review of the paraphrasing pipeline, identified several critical bugs and dead code, implemented the fixes, and verified them with manual tests, significantly improving code quality and correctness.",
  "brief_summary": "The user asked for an explanation of the paraphrasing pipeline. Claude explored the code, provided a summary, and then used a code reviewer agent to identify bugs. The user approved the fixes, which Claude then implemented, including removing dead code and fixing path errors. After guidance from the user to use `dotenv`, Claude successfully ran verification tests to confirm the fixes worked.",
