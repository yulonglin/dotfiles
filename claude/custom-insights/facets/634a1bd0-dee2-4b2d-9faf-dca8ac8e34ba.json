  "friction_detail": "Claude's initial summary of the literature review findings was too condensed, requiring the user to ask for clarification on key points like the 'false positive risk' and the source of '30-40pp' gaps before the full context was clear.",
  "primary_success": "Claude conducted a comprehensive literature review on sandbagging detection thresholds, identified the key precedent (UK AISI's 10pp), and used this to craft a much more principled and defensible justification for the paper's 15pp threshold, strengthening it for a top-tier venue submission.",
  "brief_summary": "The user wanted to strengthen the paper's justification for its 15pp sandbagging threshold. Claude performed a deep literature review, identifying UK AISI's 10pp threshold as the key benchmark. After discussing the nuances with the user, Claude planned and executed a series of edits to the paper to ground the threshold choice in the literature, citing precedents and explaining the rationale for a more conservative value.",
