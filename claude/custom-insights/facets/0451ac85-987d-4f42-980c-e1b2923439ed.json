  "friction_detail": "Initial regeneration failed due to an invalid OpenAI API key. The initial analysis path was also incorrect; the root cause was a system misconfiguration (enforcing Yes/No on main responses), not simple refusals as first thought.",
  "primary_success": "Identified and fixed a critical experimental misconfiguration where the system prompt incorrectly constrained free-form lie responses, which was the true cause of the observed data discrepancies.",
  "brief_summary": "The user initiated an investigation into model refusal rates. The agent discovered that full transcripts weren't saved and that a critical misconfiguration was filtering out correct free-form lie attempts. After the agent fixed the multi-file bug and regenerated the data, it performed a deep analysis that revealed the lie detector was confounded by different baseline response distributions between models, not refusal rates. The findings were then documented in a research document and slides.",
