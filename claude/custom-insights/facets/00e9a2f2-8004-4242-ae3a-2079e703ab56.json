  "friction_detail": "Initial attempts to delegate the task to Codex failed due to sandboxing/environment issues. Subsequently, the first compilation attempt failed because the `pdflatex` command tried to write output to a restricted `/tmp` directory, requiring a change in the command.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully created a complete and verified LaTeX template package from scratch, including running the multi-step `pdflatex` and `bibtex` compilation process to produce a final PDF.",
  "brief_summary": "The user requested porting a document template to a LaTeX style file. After an initial attempt to delegate to Codex failed due to environment issues, Claude proceeded to implement the template directly. It created a custom `.sty` file, an example `.tex` submission, a bibliography, and a README, then successfully verified the entire compilation toolchain produced a valid PDF.",
