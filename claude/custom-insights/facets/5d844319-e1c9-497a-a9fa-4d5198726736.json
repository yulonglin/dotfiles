  "brief_summary": "Claude executed a detailed, pre-approved 7-step plan to update a paper's figures and text. This included switching to a new plotting style, creating a new 'adversarial proof-of-concept' figure, updating data sources, and editing the LaTeX document. The session also involved several iterative refinements to the figures based on user feedback.",
