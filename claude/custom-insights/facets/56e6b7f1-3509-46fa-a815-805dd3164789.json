  "friction_detail": "Claude's initial audit was inaccurate, flagging commented-out `[TBD]` markers as gaps in the visible paper. It also incorrectly flagged a lack of citations for an argument that was framed differently in the paper than in the user's blog post.",
  "primary_success": "Despite initial inaccuracies, Claude successfully course-corrected based on user feedback, leading to a more accurate and nuanced audit of the paper's claims versus its evidence.",
  "brief_summary": "The user requested an audit of a research paper. Claude's initial analysis contained errors due to misinterpreting commented-out LaTeX code. Through an iterative dialogue with the user, these errors were corrected, leading to a more accurate list of inconsistencies and unsupported claims.",
