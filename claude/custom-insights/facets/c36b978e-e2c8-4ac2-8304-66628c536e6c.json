  "friction_detail": "Agent initially misinterpreted the request for 'monitor prompts' and instead found 'elicitation prompts' used to trigger sandbagging models. The user had to clarify multiple times that they were looking for the prompts used by the 'blue team' judge/monitor, not the 'red team' model.",
  "primary_success": "Correctly identifying that the sandbagging behavior is baked into the model weights rather than being prompt-injected, and explaining the 'red team vs blue team' artifact separation as the reason for the missing monitor prompts.",
  "brief_summary": "The user explored the codebase looking for monitor prompts used to detect sandbagging and other suspicious behaviors. The agent initially found elicitation prompts but, after clarification, correctly determined that the monitor prompts were not in the repository. The key insight was that the sandbagging behavior is embedded in the model weights, and the repo contains red-team artifacts, while the blue-team monitor prompts are likely withheld.",
