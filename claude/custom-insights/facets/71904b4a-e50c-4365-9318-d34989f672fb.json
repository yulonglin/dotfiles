  "friction_detail": "Claude failed to follow the most critical instruction: to copy the full 1494-line main.tex. Instead, it edited an existing 190-line stub file, resulting in a completely incorrect, short paper. The user had to intervene multiple times to correct this fundamental error.",

  "brief_summary": "The user provided a detailed plan to reformat a LaTeX paper for a new conference. Claude failed to follow the core instruction of copying the full source file, instead editing a small, existing stub.
