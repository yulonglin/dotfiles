  "friction_detail": "Claude initially misidentified which parameters were essential for comparability and had to be corrected by the user to mark the correct ones.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully restructured a documentation section to more clearly distinguish between controlled hyperparameters and descriptive metadata for experimental reporting.",
  "brief_summary": "The user wanted to clarify which hyperparameters were essential for fair experimental comparisons in the project's documentation. Claude proposed and implemented a new table structure. After the user corrected which items should be marked as essential, Claude finalized the changes.",
