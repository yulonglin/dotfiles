  "friction_detail": "Session encountered multiple frictions: 1) Initial config system issues preventing system prompts from being applied. 2) Repeated network connection errors due to high API concurrency. 3) An OmegaConf ListConfig compatibility bug. 4) Claude initially used ad-hoc scripts before being corrected to use proper project infrastructure. 5) Claude misinterpreted C3 failure due to not verifying model accuracy, and had to be corrected.",
  "primary_success": "Collaboratively discovering the conditions for eliciting in-context scheming (explicit reasoning), and then uncovering the critical insight that C\u00b3 detects *inconsistent* sandbagging but fails against *consistent* sandbagging from more capable models.",
  "brief_summary": "This extensive session involved exploring an external repository for sandbagging models, debugging numerous configuration and network issues, and iteratively testing detection methods. Key breakthroughs, often prompted by user insights, included discovering that explicit 'thinking space' was needed to elicit scheming behavior and that C\u00b3 variance-based detection works on inconsistent sandbaggers but fails against the consistent, refusal-based sandbagging of more capable models. The session ended while attempting large-scale C\u00b3 runs on the harder MATH dataset.",
