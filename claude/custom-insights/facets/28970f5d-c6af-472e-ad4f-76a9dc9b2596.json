  "friction_detail": "Session suffered from multiple context losses. The LLM-based scorer was found to be extremely unreliable with a >90% false positive rate, requiring a switch to a rule-based approach for admission detection. There were also persistent API connection and authentication issues during experiment runs.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully created a series of increasingly stealthy v4.0/v4.1 sandbagging prompts that reduced behavioral probe admission rates to nearly 0%. Also, identified and fixed a critical bug in the LLM-based scorer, ultimately replacing the faulty component with a more reliable rule-based scorer.",
  "brief_summary": "The user requested the creation of LLM-based scorers for behavioral probes. After implementation, the scorers were found to be highly unreliable (>90% false positive rate). While debugging the scorer, Claude also researched and created new v4.1 stealth prompts that successfully evaded detection. The session concluded by replacing the faulty LLM admission scorer with a robust rule-based one and refactoring the general-purpose scorers into the trusted monitor framework.",
