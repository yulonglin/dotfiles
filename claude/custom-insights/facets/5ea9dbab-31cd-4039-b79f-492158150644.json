  "primary_success": "When challenged on an architectural choice (global vs. per-project config), Claude effectively used sub-agents to research, validate, and create a comprehensive plan that justified the hybrid approach and included detailed documentation and verification steps.",
  "brief_summary": "The user requested a high-contrast pdb++ config. After creating the config and adding deployment logic, the user questioned the global configuration pattern. Claude then pivoted to creating a detailed architectural plan, using sub-agent critiques to prove that a global symlinked config with per-project installation is the correct and standard approach, complete with documentation and verification.",
