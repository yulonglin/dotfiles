  "friction_detail": "Claude initially focused on a micro-optimization (scroll throttling) suggested by a sub-agent, before the user clarified the more significant issue was a visual bug where text changed size after loading.",
  "primary_success": "Correctly diagnosed a Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) issue, explaining it was a Flash of Unstyled Text (FOUT) caused by the custom font loading after the fallback font was rendered. The fix, changing `font-display: auto` to `swap`, is the modern best practice for this problem.",
  "brief_summary": "The user noticed text jumping in size after page load. After a brief misstep focusing on scroll throttling, Claude correctly diagnosed the problem as a font-loading issue (FOUT) and fixed it by changing the `font-display` property in the site's CSS, while also correcting other minor bugs.",
