  "primary_success": "Successfully recovering from multiple, cascading tool and API failures to still deliver a high-quality, comprehensive synthesis of project ideas that incorporated all available information.",
  "brief_summary": "The user initiated a brainstorm for an AI governance hackathon. The automated pipeline faced multiple API errors, which Claude diagnosed and attempted to fix.
