  "friction_detail": "The session involved debugging a subtle data splitting bug (double truncation), a misconfiguration that caused baseline experiments to run on the wrong dataset, and fighting with Hydra's CLI syntax for list overrides. These were all successfully resolved.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully standardized 3-fold CV across the repo, fixed a data splitting bug to prevent sample loss, documented exact dataset sizes, and ran baseline experiments to make a data-driven decision to use MATH Level 5 for future work.",
  "brief_summary": "The user initiated a task to standardize dataset splits. This led to Claude discovering and fixing a bug in the splitting logic, refactoring the codebase from 5-fold to 3-fold CV, and running baseline experiments to determine the optimal MATH dataset configuration (Level 5). The final standards were documented in CLAUDE.md.",
