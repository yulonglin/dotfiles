  "primary_success": "Diagnosed a subtle platform-specific configuration issue (Ghostty's clipboard behavior on macOS) and provided the correct setting.",
  "brief_summary": "The user asked to change their Ghostty terminal configuration. Claude added the settings, but the user reported an issue with copy-on-select. Claude then diagnosed that a specific value was needed for macOS system clipboard integration, fixed the config, and committed only the relevant changes.",
