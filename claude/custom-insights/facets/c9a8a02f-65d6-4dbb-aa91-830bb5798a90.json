  "brief_summary": "Continuing from the previous session, Claude implemented the plan to add epoch support to the prompt selection pipeline. This involved modifying configuration files, the runner script, and the caching logic to include an `_eN` suffix in cache filenames for multi-epoch runs, while maintaining backward compatibility. After verification, the changes were committed.",
