  "brief_summary": "The user provided a detailed rubric for reviewing ML papers. Claude created a new skill, `review-paper`, to encapsulate this logic. Following user feedback, Claude refactored the skill to move the rubric into a separate reference file, improving its structure, and then committed the final result.",
