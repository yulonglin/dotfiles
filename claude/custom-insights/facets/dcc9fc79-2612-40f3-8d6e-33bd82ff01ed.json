  "friction_detail": "There was a prolonged and confused discussion about transcript examples for Trusted Monitor failures, with both user and Claude initially misinterpreting the nuances of whether the monitor was succeeding or failing and why.",
  "primary_success": "Collaboratively arriving at the key insight that the Trusted Monitor fails by collapsing 'sandbagging detection' into 'correctness checking,' and then successfully reframing the paper's appendix to reflect this.",
  "brief_summary": "The user and Claude engaged in a deep, collaborative discussion to understand and articulate the failure modes of baseline methods. After much back-and-forth dissecting transcript examples, they honed in on the key insight that the Trusted Monitor relies on 'correctness checking' instead of behavioral signals. Claude then updated the paper's appendix with a revised example and clearer text to reflect this nuanced finding.",
