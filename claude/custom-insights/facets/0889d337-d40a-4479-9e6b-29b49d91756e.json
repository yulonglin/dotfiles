  "friction_detail": "Early in the process, the `claude skills` command didn't yield the expected skill list, forcing a change in investigation strategy.",
  "primary_success": "Claude systematically untangled multiple interlocking plugin issues, correctly identifying that one 'marketplace' was actually the main CLI repo and another was an out-of-sync git clone, leading to a clear and correct resolution plan.",
  "brief_summary": "The user reported several plugin installation problems. Using a systematic debugging approach, Claude investigated and identified the root causes: a misconfigured marketplace pointing to the main Claude Code repository and an out-of-sync official marketplace clone. After confirming its findings with specialized sub-agents, Claude presented a clear cleanup and reinstallation plan.",
