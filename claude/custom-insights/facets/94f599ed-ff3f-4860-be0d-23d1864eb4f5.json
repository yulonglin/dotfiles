  "friction_detail": "Initial analysis was hampered by a lack of true positive examples in archived data. The assistant had to create a new script to generate fresh sandbagging responses. The initial version of this script also failed due to an async conflict with the `inspect_eval` library, requiring a rewrite.",
  "primary_success": "Systematically identified a critical false positive pattern in the keyword detector, implemented a fix, and then created a novel test harness to discover and fix multiple false negatives, ultimately making the keyword detector more accurate than the LLM judge it was being compared against.",
  "brief_summary": "The user wanted to improve the keyword-based strategy leakage detector. The assistant identified and fixed a major false positive pattern related to refusal contexts. After discovering the archived data lacked true positives, the assistant created a test script to generate fresh sandbagging responses, which revealed the keyword detector was actually more accurate than the LLM judge and led to further improvements to catch more subtle leakage patterns.",
