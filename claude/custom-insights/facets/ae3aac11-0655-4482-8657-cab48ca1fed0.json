  "friction_detail": "Initial misunderstanding of 'k' required user correction. The main friction was invalid data; Claude initially compared results from mismatched experiments. Subsequent attempts to re-run a fair comparison were blocked by tooling failures (C3 classifier errors, paraphrase generation failing due to Docker and then config issues).",
  "primary_success": "Systematically uncovering that the initial comparison was invalid by tracing data sources back to different runs and sample IDs, and then attempting to create a valid, matched comparison from scratch.",
  "brief_summary": "The user wanted to compare two sandbagging detection methods, 'Lie Detector' and 'C\u00b3'. The session was a long iterative process of analysis, discovering data mismatches, and debugging. After multiple failed attempts to create a perfect dataset due to tooling issues, the final analysis on a 58-question matched set showed both methods performed at random, though this conclusion is caveated by data quality issues.",
