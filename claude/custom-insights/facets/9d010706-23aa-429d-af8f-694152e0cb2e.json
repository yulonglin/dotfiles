  "friction_detail": "Claude's initial hypotheses about history file size and a buggy hook were incorrect, requiring the user to state the problem persisted before a deeper investigation found the true root cause.",
  "primary_success": "Systematically debugged a complex startup hang, correctly identifying the non-obvious root cause: an infinite retry loop caused by orphaned plugins and a broken relative marketplace path.",
  "brief_summary": "The user reported Claude Code was hanging on startup. Claude systematically investigated, first incorrectly identifying history bloat and a buggy hook as the cause. After those fixes failed, a deeper investigation correctly pinpointed the root cause as an infinite retry loop involving orphaned plugins, and a robust fix was planned.",
