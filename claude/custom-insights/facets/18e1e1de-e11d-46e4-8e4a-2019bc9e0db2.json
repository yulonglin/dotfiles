  "friction_detail": "Claude encountered a `uv` cache permission issue and had to try a different approach. It also couldn't run `rm -rf` due to sandbox restrictions, requiring manual user intervention. The `next dev` command failed because the port was in use, requiring a process kill.",
  "primary_success": "Rapidly implementing the new \"sweep\" endpoint, including both backend logic (`analysis.py`, `routes.py`) and frontend button, in response to a user's ad-hoc request.",
  "brief_summary": "The user provided a detailed plan for a \"Dark-Box\" model auditing tool. Claude successfully implemented the Day 1 foundation, including expanding the prompt and ground-truth datasets and verifying the E2E setup. Claude also debugged an API error and then implemented a significant new feature (a \"sweep\" endpoint) requested by the user to automate frontier plot generation.",
