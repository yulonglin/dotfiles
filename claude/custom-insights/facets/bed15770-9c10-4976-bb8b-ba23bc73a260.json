  "friction_detail": "Claude initially added too much detailed content to the main text, and the user had to clarify that the bulk of the new writeup should be in the appendix with only light references in the main body.",
  "primary_success": "Claude successfully synthesized a separate writeup about a methodological confound, integrated it into the paper as a new appendix subsection, updated the main text with light cross-references, and updated related results in another appendix section, correctly following the user's direction to keep main-text changes minimal.",
  "brief_summary": "The user asked Claude to integrate a writeup on a 'TM correctness confound' into the paper. After clarifying that the bulk of the content should go into the appendix, Claude created a new appendix subsection for the writeup, added minimal cross-references in the main text, updated related numerical results elsewhere in the appendix, and committed the changes.",
