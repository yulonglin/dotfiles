  "brief_summary": "A script was failing with a `ValueError` due to inconsistent array shapes. Claude diagnosed that the cache was polluted with a mix of real 1536-dimension embeddings and mock 256-dimension embeddings from dry runs. Claude fixed the issue by adding dimension validation to the cache loading logic and correcting the mock data dimension to prevent future issues.",
