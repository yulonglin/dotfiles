  "friction_detail": "The script initially had a bug where it would kill its own process. The process matching was also too broad at first, and the script was not initially Linux-compatible. All issues were fixed.",
  "primary_success": "Created a robust, cross-platform `clear-claude-code` script with multiple flags (status, force, all, dry-run), interactive confirmation for dangerous operations, and corresponding shell aliases.",
  "brief_summary": "The user wanted to kill stray processes. This evolved into creating a full-featured script with safety checks, status flags, confirmation prompts, and aliases. The agent debugged issues like the script killing itself and ensured it was Linux-compatible.",
