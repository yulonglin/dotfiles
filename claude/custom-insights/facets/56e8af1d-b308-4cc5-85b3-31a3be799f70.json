  "friction_detail": "Claude initially assumed the fix was already applied by checking the MCP config, but failed to account for a user-level YAML config that was overriding the setting. It had to backtrack after the user confirmed the issue persisted.",
  "primary_success": "Correctly identified the true root cause: a user-level configuration file (`~/.serena/serena_config.yml`) was overriding the CLI flag in the MCP server configuration.",
  "brief_summary": "The user wanted to fix the Serena dashboard auto-opening. Claude initially thought the fix was already in the MCP config but was wrong. After the user confirmed the issue, Claude investigated further and correctly found a user-level YAML config was the true cause, then proposed a plan to fix it.",
