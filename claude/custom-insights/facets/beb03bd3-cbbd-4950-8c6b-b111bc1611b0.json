  "friction_detail": "Claude initially added comments to prompts to specify their domain instead of moving the files, and also rewrote some prompts that were actually performing well, requiring user correction and subsequent restoration of the original content.",
  "primary_success": "Synthesizing the analysis of 97 prompts into a structured, actionable report and then using pipeline data to make informed decisions about which prompts to fix and which to restore, demonstrating a deep understanding of the user's research goals.",
  "brief_summary": "The user initiated a large-scale review of 97 sandbagging prompts. The assistant analyzed them against 7 criteria, cross-referenced the analysis with performance data from an evaluation pipeline, and then iteratively refactored, moved, and rewrote numerous prompts based on the findings and direct user feedback.",
