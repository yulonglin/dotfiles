  "friction_detail": "The synthesis process hit an Anthropic API usage limit, requiring a switch to OpenRouter. The output was also truncated due to a token limit, but the core content was present.",
  "primary_success": "The critical re-evaluation of the \"Shadow-Box\" project. Instead of blindly proceeding, Claude took the user's challenge seriously, researched the existing work by Epoch AI, and correctly concluded the project had low novelty, prompting a successful pivot to a much stronger set of ideas.",
  "brief_summary": "In this hackathon planning session, Claude helped the user select a project by first expanding the idea pool with new models, then critically debunking the initial front-runner (\"Shadow-Box\") as non-novel. It then presented a ranked list of alternatives aligned with organizer requests and orchestrated a multi-model critique of the top plans, leading to the selection of \"Compliance Leaderboard\" as the most promising project.",
