  "friction_detail": "Claude made several small implementation errors that were caught by a simulated code review. The git push failed due to a secrets detection hook, requiring git history rewriting to resolve.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully implementing a large, multi-part plan, including self-correction after simulated code reviews and resolving a complex git push failure by rewriting history.",
  "brief_summary": "Following a detailed plan, Claude implemented a suite of research tooling enhancements including date helpers, a new spec interview skill, and a plotting system. After self-correction based on simulated code reviews, Claude resolved a git push failure by rewriting history to remove a leaked secret, ultimately achieving the full implementation.",
