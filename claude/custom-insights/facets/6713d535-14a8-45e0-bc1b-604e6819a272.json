  "brief_summary": "The user asked Claude to add a discussion about the 'Apollo in-context scheming' setup to their slides. Claude used a sub-agent to find detailed results in the codebase and then created new slides summarizing the findings, including the specific prompt required, the models it worked on, and the key insight that models refusing to sandbag was a new observation. The user iteratively refined the slides with Claude.",
