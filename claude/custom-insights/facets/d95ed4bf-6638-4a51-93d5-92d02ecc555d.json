  "friction_detail": "The session was plagued by technical issues: high API error rates due to excessive concurrency, a blocking cache implementation that crippled performance, and background tasks being lost. This required extensive, iterative debugging to resolve.",
  "primary_success": "Systematically debugging a complex data generation pipeline with multiple failure modes (concurrency, caching, async blocking) to successfully complete a long-running experiment and deliver a comprehensive ablation analysis.",
  "brief_summary": "The user tasked Claude with training lie detectors on various sandbagging prompts. The process was fraught with technical difficulties, including API connection errors and a severe performance bottleneck caused by a blocking cache. Through persistent, iterative debugging, Claude diagnosed and worked around the issues, successfully generated large datasets for two different models, and completed a comprehensive 31-combination ablation study to identify the most evasive sandbagging strategies.",
