  "brief_summary": "The user requested a detailed report on the 'trusted monitor' detection method. The agent searched source code, configuration files, experiment logs, and result summaries. It successfully compiled a comprehensive overview of the available monitors, their poor detection performance (AUROC ~0.53), and how they compare unfavorably to the C\u00b3 method.",
