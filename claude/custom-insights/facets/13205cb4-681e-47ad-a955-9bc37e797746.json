  "brief_summary": "The user asked about the implementation status of the prompt selection pipeline. The assistant analyzed the codebase and determined that while the foundational modules were complete and tested, the main orchestration layer (`runner.py`) was missing, preventing end-to-end execution. It provided a detailed breakdown of completed vs. missing components and a clear plan for finishing the implementation.",
