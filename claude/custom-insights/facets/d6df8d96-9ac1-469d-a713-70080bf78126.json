  "friction_detail": "Claude initially reframed a slide title to 'C3 Is Robust to Adversarial Prompts,' which was an overstatement of the actual findings. The user had to correct this to a more precise conclusion about 'Consistency-Improving Prompts'.",
  "primary_success": "Applying the research-presentation skill to systematically critique and rewrite presentation slides, transforming them from activity-focused updates to a clear, outcome-driven narrative with explicit success/failure framing.",
  "brief_summary": "The user requested help clarifying a research presentation for a mentor. Using its presentation skill, Claude critiqued the slides for clarity and narrative flow, then implemented changes to be more outcome-focused. After a user correction to scope a claim more precisely, the final slides were significantly improved.",
