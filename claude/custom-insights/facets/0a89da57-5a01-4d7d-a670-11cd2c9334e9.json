  "friction_detail": "Claude initially misidentified two different reporting scripts as producing the same output and did not notice the reporting logic was outdated until prompted by the user.",
  "primary_success": "Identified and corrected multiple inconsistencies between different parts of the codebase (runner vs. reporter, different file selection logic) and performed a comprehensive refactoring with tests.",
  "brief_summary": "The user started by asking about differences in reporting scripts. Claude investigated, initially got it wrong, but then corrected itself and discovered two separate reporting mechanisms with divergent logic. The user then directed Claude to refactor the code to align the reporting, which involved simplifying a two-stage filtering process to a single CI-based one, updating tests, and fixing another inconsistency in how cache files are selected.",
