  "friction_detail": "The initial plan didn't fully resolve the user's issue, as duplicates still appeared in the Claude Code UI. Claude also had to debug why `find` was reporting incorrect counts in a subshell and why `trash` failed on symlinked directories.",
  "primary_success": "Correctly diagnosed the true root cause of the UI duplicates: wrapper directories in `claude/skills/` being loaded alongside the original plugin skills, a separate issue from the symlink problem.",
  "brief_summary": "The user wanted to fix duplicate skills. Claude implemented a plan to clean up symlinks and sync scripts, but duplicates remained in the UI. After further investigation, Claude correctly diagnosed the deeper root cause: wrapper directories in the user skills folder mirroring plugin skills, leading to double registration by Claude Code's runtime.",
