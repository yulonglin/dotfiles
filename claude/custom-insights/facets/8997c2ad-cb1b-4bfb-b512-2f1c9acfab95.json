  "friction_detail": "The agent initially proposed documenting a 'manual review' process for a keyword filter, but the user clarified this process doesn't exist. The agent then correctly pivoted to suggesting using an LLM judge for contextual analysis instead.",
  "primary_success": "Identifying a critical ambiguity in the prompt selection pipeline (ranking vs. thresholding for Vendi score) and a conceptual issue (prompt vs. output diversity), then proposing a clear, pragmatic stopping criterion (top-10 per dataset) which was adopted.",
  "brief_summary": "The user asked for a critique of a prompt selection pipeline spec. The agent analyzed the use of Vendi score for diversity, identified ambiguities in the stopping criterion, and raised a conceptual point about prompt vs. output diversity. After a collaborative discussion, the agent drafted and applied specific, clarifying edits to both the spec file and the associated research paper.",
