  "friction_detail": "The agent's first attempt to fix the algorithm formatting was incorrect for the `algorithmic` package. It also took multiple steps to diagnose and fix the broken citations, first trying the compile script, then checking BibTeX output, before correctly identifying the missing `BIBINPUTS` in `latexmkrc` for Overleaf compatibility.",
  "primary_success": "Claude correctly diagnosed that broken citations were due to a missing `BIBINPUTS` path in the `latexmkrc` file, ensuring compatibility with both local compilation and Overleaf, and also simplified the local compile script.",
  "brief_summary": "The user reported janky algorithm formatting and broken citations. Claude first refactored the algorithm to match ICML style, then diagnosed the citation issue by identifying a missing path in the `latexmkrc` file. It fixed the configuration, simplified the compile script, and updated project documentation.",
