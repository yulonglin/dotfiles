  "friction_detail": "Claude initially mis-stated that Noise Injection is a black-box method, but quickly self-corrected that it, along with CCS and Linear Probes, requires white-box access.",
  "primary_success": "Identified a fundamental logical flaw in the 'Indirect Dependency Probing' method: that a sophisticated sandbagger would also fake the dependent task, making the method ineffective. This was supported by a literature search of the UK AISI Auditing Games paper.",
  "brief_summary": "User requested a review of the 'Indirect Dependency Probing' method. Claude and a research advisor identified a critical flaw: it would only work against naive, not sophisticated, sandbaggers. Claude then performed a literature search, finding that the UK AISI Auditing Games paper confirms black-box methods like this often fail. The session concluded with a plan to deprecate the method and document the findings.",
