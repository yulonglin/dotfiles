  "brief_summary": "The user wanted to build a memory system for Claude. Through a long, exploratory dialogue, Claude researched what practitioners use and collaboratively designed a pragmatic plan. The final plan pivoted away from a complex custom build to using `claude-mem`, migrating plans/tasks to be per-project, and adding stale-doc detection, fully addressing the user's core pain points and constraints.",
