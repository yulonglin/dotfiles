  "friction_detail": "Claude's attempt to run the Streamlit application failed due to a `PermissionError` when trying to bind to the default port, which prevented direct verification of the fix.",
  "primary_success": "Correctly identified and fixed multiple distinct issues across the codebase, including a deprecated pandas function (`applymap`), polymorphic data handling (`evidence`), and UI display formatting.",
  "brief_summary": "The user provided a plan to fix a broken Streamlit dashboard. Claude implemented all the specified code fixes, addressing issues with pandas deprecation, data type polymorphism, and UI styling. When the user reported the tabs were still blank, Claude diagnosed the problem as a likely port permission issue preventing the server from starting and provided commands to run the app on an alternative port.",
