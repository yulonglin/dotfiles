  "friction_detail": "Claude initially couldn't find the bibtex entry for a citation (soares2025deep) and the user had to provide a link to the source paper's bib file.",
  "primary_success": "Claude successfully integrated multiple complex points from the UK AISI paper into the user's paper, strengthening its arguments and positioning it within the existing literature by adding content to the Related Work, Problem Setting, and Limitations sections.",
  "brief_summary": "The user wanted to revise their paper based on a UK AISI sandbagging paper. Claude analyzed the provided text, proposed revisions to align methodology (McNemar test) and address gaps (prompted vs. password-locked sandbagging, black-box lie detection). After user approval, Claude implemented all changes, including adding new citations and updating the limitations section.",
