  "friction_detail": "Claude initially assumed deployment was via gh-pages based on a script in package.json, but quickly corrected its plan when the user mentioned they use Netlify.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully managed the entire migration to Bun, including creating a `netlify.toml` file to ensure the build environment matches the local setup, demonstrating an understanding of both local tooling and CI/CD configuration.",
  "brief_summary": "The user wanted to switch their project to use Bun. Claude guided the process, creating a `bun.lockb` file, adding a `netlify.toml` to configure the production build environment, and updating `package.json` scripts to be more ergonomic (e.g., adding a `dev` alias for the `develop` script).",
