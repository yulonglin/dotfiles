  "brief_summary": "Using the spec-interview skill, the agent analyzed a literature review document and the existing codebase to determine which sandbagging prompts were missing. It proposed a clear implementation plan, engaged the user with clarifying questions to resolve ambiguities, and then generated a complete specification document (`specs/add-lit-review-prompts.md`) for the work.",
