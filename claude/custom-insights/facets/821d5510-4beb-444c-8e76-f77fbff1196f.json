  "friction_detail": "Initial misunderstanding of the user's question about resampling, which was quickly clarified and addressed.",
  "primary_success": "Provided a deep, statistically-grounded analysis of resampling vs. paraphrasing, acting as a 'research advisor' to guide the user to a more robust methodology, and then implemented the documentation changes across multiple files.",
  "brief_summary": "The user inquired about the correctness and sampling methods in a detection algorithm. Through an iterative discussion, the agent explained the current implementation, provided a detailed statistical rationale for using paraphrasing over simple resampling, and helped refine the methodology. It then updated the markdown documentation, a YAML config, and a Python docstring to reflect this more robust, agreed-upon approach.",
