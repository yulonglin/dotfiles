  "brief_summary": "The user asked Claude to review a test suite. Claude found that while all tests passed, they failed to verify a key sorting requirement. Following the TDD process, Claude added new, failing tests to cover this gap, then updated the implementation to track transaction volume and use the correct sorting logic, resulting in a fully spec-compliant and tested feature.",
