  "brief_summary": "The user pointed out that the term 'refusal' was ambiguous in the codebase. The agent analyzed the code, confirmed two different concepts were being conflated, and proposed renaming all relevant files and functions to `sandbag_refusal_*`. The agent then executed the renames, updated all documentation, and committed the changes.",
