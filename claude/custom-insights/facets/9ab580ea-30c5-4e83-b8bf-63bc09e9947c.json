  "underlying_goal": "To improve a hackathon proposal by critiquing it against the judging criteria, strengthening a key weakness (small dataset) by doing research, and then using a multi-agent review process to refine the improved proposal.",

  "friction_detail": "The `codex` agent, intended as one of the three critics, crashed. Claude adapted by replacing it with a `red-team` agent, which was a better fit for the task anyway.",
  "primary_success": "Claude identified a key weakness in a proposal (N=2 dataset), performed external research to find ~18 more relevant data points, updated the proposal to incorporate them, and then orchestrated and synthesized a three-agent critique of the *strengthened* proposal, leading to a high-quality final action plan.",
  "brief_summary": "Claude critiqued a hackathon proposal, identified a small dataset as a key weakness, and researched to find 18+ more models to expand it. After updating the proposal, Claude orchestrated a three-agent (Gemini, Claude, red-team) review of the improved version, synthesized their feedback, and negotiated a final set of actionable improvements with the user.",
