  "friction_detail": "The session resumed after context loss, requiring re-extraction of Q3 test cases. The JavaScript extraction script repeatedly truncated large outputs, forcing Claude to adopt a slower, one-case-at-a-time extraction strategy to get the full data.",
  "primary_success": "Overcoming unreliable browser automation (flaky navigation, truncated JS output) by systematically debugging and creating workarounds, such as finding correct coordinates and extracting test cases one-by-one, to successfully complete the large-scale data scraping task.",
  "brief_summary": "Resuming a task to scrape 16 sets of test cases from a website, Claude recovered from context loss by re-extracting the required data. It worked around browser tool limitations, like output truncation, by modifying its scraping script to fetch data piece by piece. Ultimately, it successfully saved all 16 `test_cases.json` files and verified their integrity.",
