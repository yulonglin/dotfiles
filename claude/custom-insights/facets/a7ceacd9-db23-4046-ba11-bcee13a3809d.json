  "friction_detail": "Claude's initial set of 'bad examples' for ad-hoc commands was slightly off-base, as the user pointed out the examples were valid for simple sanity checks. Claude then refined the examples to clarify that the issue is using those results as final, reported data.",
  "primary_success": "Collaboratively refined documentation in CLAUDE.md to clearly distinguish between 'actual experiment runs' (which must use existing scripts for correctness) and 'dry runs' (where ad-hoc commands are acceptable).",
  "brief_summary": "User wanted to enforce using existing scripts for experiments. Through several rounds of feedback, guidance in `CLAUDE.md` was refined to focus on the key risks of ad-hoc commands (wrong hyperparameters, incorrect metrics) and to clarify the distinction between legitimate dry runs and improper final experiment runs. The final documentation was then committed.",
