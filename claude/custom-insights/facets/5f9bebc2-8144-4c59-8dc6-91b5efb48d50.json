  "friction_detail": "Briefly misunderstood the status of a background task, thinking it had completed successfully when it had actually failed earlier. The agent self-corrected in the next turn.",
  "primary_success": "Claude performed an outstandingly thorough and systematic investigation of numerical discrepancies in a research paper. It successfully traced data sources, reconciled text with figures, edited LaTeX files, regenerated figures, and updated the paper's core claims (changing 'mean' to 'median' aggregation everywhere), demonstrating a deep understanding of the research context.",
  "brief_summary": "The user asked Claude to resolve 10 TODOs about numerical discrepancies in a paper. Claude systematically investigated each one, verifying prompt counts, reconciling text-figure mismatches (e.g., USACO vs GPQA), regenerating figures with correct parameters, and changing the core aggregation method from 'mean' to 'median' throughout the paper's text, algorithm, and abstract. The session was a deep, successful debugging and correction effort.",
