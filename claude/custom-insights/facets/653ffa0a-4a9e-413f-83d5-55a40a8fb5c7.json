  "friction_detail": "Initial misunderstanding where the agent only performed documentation updates, but then correctly identified that code changes (k=5->10 defaults, adding SEM output) were also required by the plan.",
  "primary_success": "Correctly implementing the full plan, including not just documentation updates but also identifying the need for code changes (adding SEM output to split mode, updating k=5 defaults) and resolving the correct statistical approach (bootstrap entire pipeline).",
  "brief_summary": "The user requested implementation of a plan to standardize reporting documentation. The agent updated multiple documentation files to align with the paper's conventions (e.g., using k=10 as default). The conversation then delved into a deep statistical discussion, leading to the identification of a gap in the code (no SEM for split mode) and the implementation of a more principled 'bootstrap entire pipeline' method to correctly calculate variance.",
