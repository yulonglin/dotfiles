  },
  "friction_detail": "Initial agent calls failed and had to be retried. There was also a significant back-and-forth to clarify the novelty of the user's research methodology (same-model vs. mixed-model evaluation), which required multiple plan revisions.",
  "primary_success": "Claude successfully synthesized critiques from multiple AI personas and external council feedback to create a robust, targeted plan for an academic workshop paper, including a strong narrative angle, page budget, and preemptive rebuttal of likely reviewer objections.",
  "brief_summary": "The user tasked Claude with reframing a research paper for a 'negative results' workshop. Claude proposed focusing on the failure of baseline detection methods, a framing that was iteratively refined with feedback from the user and other AI agents. The session involved clarifying the novelty of the research, incorporating detailed critiques, and resulted in a comprehensive, structured plan for the paper, which was then committed to the repository.",
