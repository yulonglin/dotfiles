  "primary_success": "Claude performed a security audit of the plugin, correctly identifying the key security surface (JS hooks vs. markdown prompts), analyzing the install script and network calls, and providing a clear 'Safe to use' verdict. It then gave an insightful comparison of the plugin's workflow against the user's existing, more research-oriented setup.",
  "brief_summary": "The user asked if the `get-shit-done` repository was safe and useful for their workflow. Claude conducted a security audit, deeming it safe after analyzing its hooks and install script. It then compared the plugin's product-dev focus to the user's research-focused setup, correctly identifying overlaps and concluding it was not a strong fit, thus saving the user from adopting a redundant tool.",
