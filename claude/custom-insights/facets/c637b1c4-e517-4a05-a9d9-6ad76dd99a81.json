  "brief_summary": "To test a 'Stealth Spectrum' hypothesis for a paper, the user proposed an experiment to separate prompt format effects from sandbagging type. The agent explored the codebase, designed a 2x2 factorial experiment (GPQA/USACO x with/without explanations), and created a detailed implementation plan, which was then refined for experimental rigor (e.g., using dev set, enabling batch mode).",
