  "friction_detail": "The user's changes were reverted when another process or agent session overwrote the generated figure files. There was also a misunderstanding where the user perceived the PDF as 'corrupted', which was likely a local viewer cache issue.",
  "primary_success": "Correctly identifying the Python script and matplotlib settings responsible for figure generation and modifying them to increase font sizes.",
  "brief_summary": "The user wanted to increase the text size in several paper figures. The agent located the Python generation script, increased matplotlib font sizes, and regenerated the figures. The session involved friction when the generated figures were overwritten by another process, requiring the agent to regenerate them again.",
