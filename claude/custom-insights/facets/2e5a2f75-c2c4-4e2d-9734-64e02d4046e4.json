  "friction_detail": "The agent's initial attempt to query APIs was blocked by a proxy, but it gracefully failed over to providing dashboard links. Later, when asked to 'fix the agent,' Claude's API returned two 'overloaded' errors.",
  "primary_success": "Claude correctly identified which provider (OpenRouter) had a programmatic API for balance checks, retrieved the balance, and for the others (OpenAI, Anthropic), correctly explained that it requires dashboard access and provided the correct URLs.",
  "brief_summary": "The user asked for LLM billing stats. Claude used the `llm-billing` skill, successfully queried OpenRouter for the remaining credit balance, and correctly informed the user that OpenAI and Anthropic require manual dashboard checks for balances and limit-setting, providing the relevant links. The session ended after some transient API overload errors.",
