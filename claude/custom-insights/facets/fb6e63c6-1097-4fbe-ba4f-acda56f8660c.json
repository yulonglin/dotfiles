  "friction_detail": "Sub-agents lacked web access to read mentor stream pages, leading to initial answers being misaligned with mentors' current projects. The main agent had to fetch the content later and revise the answers. Context limits were also hit repeatedly.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully orchestrating a complex, multi-agent workflow to generate 12 distinct application answers, and then course-correcting by fetching missing web content to fix initial inaccuracies in the generated drafts.",
  "brief_summary": "The user initiated a complex task to generate answers for 12 mentor streams in a MATS application. Claude spun up parallel agents, but they lacked web access, resulting in generic initial drafts. Claude then fetched the required web content, orchestrated the revision of the incorrect answers, and compiled all 12 tailored responses into the final application file.",
