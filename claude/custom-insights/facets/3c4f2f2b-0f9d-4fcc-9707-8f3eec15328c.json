  "friction_detail": "Claude briefly introduced a bug by placing a LaTeX `%` comment on the same line as code, which it then fixed. There was also a moment of confusion where it seemed like edits to `main.tex` weren't being saved, which turned out to be an auto-commit from an external tool.",
  "primary_success": "Systematically processing 74 detailed review comments on a long LaTeX paper, applying dozens of targeted edits, and correctly identifying items that needed external verification and flagging them with TODOs.",
  "brief_summary": "The user provided a PDF with 74 review comments on a research paper. Claude systematically addressed each comment, making numerous edits to the LaTeX source for content, wording, and citations, while intelligently flagging items needing external verification. After completing all edits and verifying compilation, it produced a summary of the changes and wrote it to a file.",
