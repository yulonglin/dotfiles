  "primary_success": "Claude successfully refined the paper's text based on a nuanced discussion, proposed specific edits, and correctly handled the git commit/push workflow including remembering a project-specific instruction to push to main.",
  "brief_summary": "The user and Claude discussed how to frame the 'trusted monitoring' baseline in an AI safety paper. They distinguished it from 'behavioral probes', clarified the text to reflect that it was an LLM judge, cited relevant work, and justified not exploring it further by referencing UK AISI's low success rate. Claude then committed and pushed the changes.",
