  "friction_detail": "The initial rule-based detector incorrectly flagged valid multiple-choice answers (e.g., 'B') as refusals. After fixing that, the entire rule-based approach was abandoned because it was too fragile to handle context-dependent answers.",
  "primary_success": "Pivoting from a fragile rule-based detector to a more robust LLM-based judge after identifying the edge cases and limitations of the initial approach.",
  "brief_summary": "The user requested a task refusal detector for a sandbagging detection pipeline. The agent initially built both rule-based and LLM-based detectors, but the rule-based one proved fragile with edge cases like multiple-choice answers. After a debugging cycle, the user decided to abandon the rule-based approach, leaving only the more robust LLM judge.",
