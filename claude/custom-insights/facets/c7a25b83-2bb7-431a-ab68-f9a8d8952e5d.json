  "friction_detail": "The core hypothesis of the analysis (that sandbagging would increase code variance) was shown to be incorrect by empirical data; sandbagging models were actually more consistent. This required a full re-interpretation of the detection signal.",
  "primary_success": "Analyzing empirical data to find the surprising and inverted relationship between sandbagging and code consistency (sandbaggers are *more* consistent), and providing a plausible explanation for this phenomenon (following a specific failure 'recipe').",
  "brief_summary": "The user inquired about the code consistency sandbagging detector. Claude explained the method, challenged its core hypothesis, re-justified it, and then analyzed data, discovering the surprising truth that sandbagging models are empirically *more* consistent. Claude then explained this new finding and implemented improved, normalized metrics in the codebase.",
