  "primary_success": "Claude effectively facilitated a brainstorming session, clearly explaining a technical concept (hooks) and then using the user's feedback to generate a well-structured, research-first implementation plan for a new 'humanizer' feature.",
  "brief_summary": "The user wanted to create a tool to make writing more 'human'. Claude initiated a brainstorming session, explained how Claude Code hooks could work, and asked clarifying questions. Based on the user's preference for a research-first approach, Claude generated a detailed implementation plan.",
