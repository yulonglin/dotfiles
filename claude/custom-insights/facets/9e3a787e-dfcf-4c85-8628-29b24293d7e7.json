  "primary_success": "Claude researched real-world dangerous capability evaluation (DCE) task counts across multiple AI labs, synthesized the findings to strongly justify the choice of k=10, and integrated this justification into the paper with a new appendix table and multiple new citations.",
  "brief_summary": "The user wanted to improve the paper's explanation of bootstrap resampling. The session evolved into a deep dive to justify the hyperparameter k=10. Claude researched DCE task counts at several AI labs, found a consistent pattern of 6-15 tasks, and used this to create a strong, literature-backed justification in the main text and a new appendix, which was then committed.",
