  "primary_success": "Claude correctly diagnosed that a CLI tool lacked a feature (model listing), provided the correct alternative procedure (querying the API), and then updated the tool's documentation to reflect this, including refactoring the documentation into a separate reference file at the user's request.",
  "brief_summary": "The user asked how to list and select models for the `codex` skill. Claude determined the CLI lacked this feature and explained the correct API-based method. It then documented this procedure, first in the main skill file and then, at the user's suggestion, refactoring it into a separate `references/model-selection.md` file before committing and pushing the changes.",
