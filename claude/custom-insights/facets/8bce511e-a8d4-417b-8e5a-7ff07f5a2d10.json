  "friction_detail": "The initial caching implementation had async race conditions that needed to be fixed with `asyncio.Lock`. Also, a downstream bug was found where a config file referenced a strategy (`technical`) that was never defined.",

  "brief_summary": "The user asked to add caching to the runtime paraphraser. Claude implemented it, but review found race conditions. Claude fixed the concurrency issues using `asyncio.Lock`, fixed related failing tests, and also diagnosed and fixed a separate bug where a config file referenced an undefined paraphrase strategy.",
