  "brief_summary": "The user requested a review of a large diff. The agent identified systemic 'over-hedging' and other structural issues. It then compared the writing style to gold-standard papers to derive a clear principle for hedging, created a specific spec for fixes, and generated a general `writing-guidelines.md` document for future use.",
