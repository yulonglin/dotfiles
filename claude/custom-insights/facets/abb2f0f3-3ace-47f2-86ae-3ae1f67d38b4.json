  "friction_detail": "The agent's first suggestion (symlinks) was incorrect for the Overleaf environment. The second attempt (modifying `latexmkrc`) also failed to solve the problem. The final, successful solution was to abandon configuration fixes and simply move the necessary `.bib` and `.bst` files to the root directory, though this introduced a file duplication issue that then had to be resolved.",
  "primary_success": "Correctly diagnosing that the BibTeX error was due to Overleaf not finding style/bibliography files in a subdirectory and resolving it by moving the files to the root directory.",
  "brief_summary": "The user reported a BibTeX error on Overleaf. The agent diagnosed the issue as Overleaf being unable to find the `.bst` file in a subdirectory. After a few unsuccessful attempts to fix the configuration (including suggesting symlinks, which don't work on Overleaf), the final solution was to move the `.bib` and `.bst` files to the root of the project, which resolved the compilation error.",
