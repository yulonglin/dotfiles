  "friction_detail": "The initial fix for the 'unbound variable' error was correct for modern bash but failed to address the root cause, which was that macOS's default bash 3.2 doesn't support associative arrays. This required a second round of debugging.",
  "primary_success": "Diagnosing that the root cause was not just a `set -u` issue but a bash version incompatibility (associative arrays not supported in macOS's default bash 3.2), and rewriting the script to use simple variables for portability.",
  "brief_summary": "The user reported an 'unbound variable' error in a shell script. The agent first fixed the issue for modern bash, but after the user showed another error, the agent correctly diagnosed the root cause as an incompatibility with macOS's older bash version. The script was then refactored to remove associative arrays, making it portable, and the fix was committed.",
