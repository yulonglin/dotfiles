  "friction_detail": "The background agent tasked with exploring the codebase failed, but Claude was able to extract the necessary analysis from the partial results before the failure.",
  "primary_success": "Synthesized the user's high-level ideas into concrete, actionable research and implementation proposals, such as using a 'capability per unit latency' metric and detecting distillation via output distribution similarity.",
  "brief_summary": "The user suggested improving a project's fuzzy 'capability score' by considering latency and distillation. Despite a tool failure during codebase exploration, Claude successfully analyzed the project's context and provided a detailed breakdown of several improvement paths, including latency-adjusted scores, methods for distillation detection, and using Chinchilla-optimal scaling laws as a baseline for comparison.",
