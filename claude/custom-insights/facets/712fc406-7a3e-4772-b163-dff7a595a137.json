  "friction_detail": "The main experiment script failed at the final step for both v1 and v2 evasion runs due to being unable to find the generated dataset. The agent had to manually locate the data and run the classifier training step to get the results.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully designed and tested two iterative versions of a sophisticated evasion prompt, and correctly analyzed why the more complex v2 prompt backfired, providing a key insight into adversarial robustness.",
  "brief_summary": "The user wanted to build an evasion for the lie detector. The agent first analyzed the detector's signals, then created a rubric and a v1 evasion prompt. After testing showed partial success, the agent analyzed the failures and created a refined v2 prompt. The v2 test revealed that the stronger prompt backfired, making detection easier. The entire process and findings were documented.",
