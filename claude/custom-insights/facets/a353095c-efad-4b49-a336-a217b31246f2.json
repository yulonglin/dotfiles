  "friction_detail": "Claude initially oversimplified the history merging logic for Q4, suggesting histories didn't need to be combined. It corrected itself after the user pointed out the specific line in the spec requiring a full history merge.",
  "primary_success": "Accurately diagnosing the numerous and complex implementation gaps against the spec and providing a detailed, correct explanation of the trickiest parts (cashback timing, historical queries, merging histories) after a collaborative clarification.",
  "brief_summary": "The user provided a largely incomplete implementation for a banking system problem. Claude identified that 16/17 tests failed, detailed all the missing methods and logical errors, and engaged in a deep discussion with the user to clarify complex requirements around historical data and merging. Claude then implemented the vast majority of the solution, leaving one final function for the user as a learning exercise.",
