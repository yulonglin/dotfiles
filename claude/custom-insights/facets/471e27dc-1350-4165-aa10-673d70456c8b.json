  "brief_summary": "The user requested to create new figures from incomplete experimental results that contradicted the paper's current claims. Recognizing the complexity, Claude conducted a 'spec interview' to understand the new data, clarify the desired narrative, and identify technical constraints. The session resulted in a comprehensive, user-approved plan for regenerating the figures and updating the paper.",
