  "brief_summary": "The user asked for the 48 lie detector probes and their per-model response rates. The agent successfully located the probe definitions and the key confound analysis document. It found that while per-probe response rate CSVs don't exist, the analysis doc revealed a 35 percentage point baseline difference in the 'yes' rate between gpt4.1-nano and gpt5-nano, proving the detector was identifying model personality, not sandbagging.",
