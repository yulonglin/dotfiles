  "friction_detail": "Initial diagnosis was difficult because Claude didn't know `level2.py` was user-implemented and passing tests, leading to a temporary misdirection before the user clarified.",
  "primary_success": "Correctly deducing that the persistent, unchanging `IndentationError` pointed to a CodeSignal platform caching bug rather than an error in the user's code, saving the user from debugging a phantom issue.",
  "brief_summary": "A user's Python file failed on CodeSignal with an `IndentationError` despite being valid locally. After several rounds of debugging, Claude correctly diagnosed the issue as a platform caching bug on CodeSignal's end because the error persisted regardless of code changes. The user then pivoted to a different task.",
