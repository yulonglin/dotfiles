  "friction_detail": "The data generation was an extremely long process (over 24 hours), and an initial background task failed and had to be restarted. The ablation script also had minor bugs that needed fixing.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully managing a very long-running, multi-day data generation and analysis task, recovering from a failure, and delivering a comprehensive ablation study with insightful conclusions about the failure of lie detectors to generalize.",
  "brief_summary": "The user requested training a lie detector on 8 new sandbagging prompts, a process that took over 24 hours to generate data. Claude managed the long-running task, recovered from an initial failure, and then ran a comprehensive ablation study, ultimately demonstrating that the detectors fail to generalize to novel sandbagging strategies, a key insight for the user's research.",
