  "friction_detail": "The session involved re-addressing the need to expand requirement granularity, which had been discussed in a previous session, leading to the creation of a new, more comprehensive plan.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully expanded the STREAM requirements to full granularity (7 to 28 items) and then correctly identified that other frameworks (EU CoP, Lab Safety) also needed similar expansion, leading to a comprehensive new implementation plan.",
  "brief_summary": "The session began by implementing a plan to fix the Streamlit UI, analyze results for insights, and add UI improvements like confidence badges. The user then requested a major scope expansion to make the evaluation rubrics fully granular, which Claude executed for the STREAM framework. After confirming other frameworks also lacked granularity, the session concluded with Claude drafting a new, comprehensive plan to expand all frameworks and add a human validation workflow.",
