  "friction_detail": "The assistant encountered several obstacles: sandbox permissions blocked `rm` commands; a heredoc for a git commit was blocked, forcing a switch to the 'commit' skill; and it initially misinterpreted 'claude doctor' output, requiring further investigation to resolve stale plugin errors.",
  "primary_success": "Claude successfully executed a complex, multi-phase plan to resolve a startup bug, including modifying .gitignore, removing tracked files with `git rm --cached`, and committing the fix, while also diagnosing and fixing an unrelated shell script syntax error.",
  "brief_summary": "The user provided a detailed plan to fix a Claude Code startup failure caused by version-controlled runtime files. The assistant executed the plan, which involved deleting local files, updating .gitignore, and removing files from git history. Despite facing sandbox permission issues and tool blockages, the assistant successfully committed the fix and even resolved a separate syntax error in a deployment script encountered during verification.",
