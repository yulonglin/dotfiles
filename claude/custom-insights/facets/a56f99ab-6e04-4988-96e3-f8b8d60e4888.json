  "brief_summary": "The user requested to address the `embedding-entropy.md` spec. Claude correctly inferred that the task was to create a general method specification by extracting the core pipeline from a verbose, dataset-specific reference document. Claude created the new, clean `embedding-entropy.md` with the general methodology, leaving specific details in their respective files.",
