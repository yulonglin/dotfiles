  "brief_summary": "The user wanted to standardize matplotlib plotting styles. Claude initiated a design discussion, asking clarifying questions about color sources and file structure. Through iterative refinement, they co-designed a plan to move plotting code to a new `lib/plotting` directory, refactor modules to use a single source of truth for colors, and update style files for consistency.",
