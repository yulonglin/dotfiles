  "friction_detail": "Claude initially wrote an entire 51-test suite based on the wrong problem specification. After multiple steps of trying to reconcile the implementation with the wrong tests, it realized its error, preserved the incorrect tests as requested by the user, and then wrote a completely new test suite based on the correct local specification.",
  "primary_success": "After realizing it had been writing tests against the wrong specification, Claude gracefully handled the mistake by preserving the incorrect work, reverting its changes to the implementation, and then quickly generating a new, correct test suite from scratch that successfully validated the existing code.",
  "brief_summary": "Tasked with writing tests via TDD, Claude initially used the wrong problem spec, leading to a large suite of failing tests. After a series of debugging steps and user guidance, it identified its mistake, pivoted, and created a new, correct test suite based on the local spec, which passed entirely. The original, incorrect tests were preserved for reference at the user's request.",
