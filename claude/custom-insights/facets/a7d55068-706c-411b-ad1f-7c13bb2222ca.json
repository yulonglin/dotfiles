  "friction_detail": "The `codex` agent crashed during the multi-agent review process, but Claude handled the failure gracefully and noted it was a known issue, proceeding with the other models.",
  "primary_success": "Claude successfully orchestrated a multi-agent critique-and-synthesis workflow, coordinating its own analysis with critiques from Gemini and GPT-5.2, performing a blind peer-ranking of the outputs, and deriving a high-quality consensus plan.",
  "brief_summary": "User asked for a critique of a paper plan against a workshop's call for papers. Claude provided a critique, then orchestrated a multi-agent review with Gemini and GPT-5.2, including a blind peer-ranking of the critiques. It synthesized the consensus feedback and updated the plan accordingly, before moving to create the LaTeX paper from the improved plan.",
