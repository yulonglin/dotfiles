  "friction_detail": "Initial misunderstanding of 'recency' (creation vs. update time). Also, Go was not initially available in the environment, preventing build verification until `mise` was used.",
  "primary_success": "After realizing the desired 'Updated' field was unavailable in the library, Claude creatively used the timestamp of the latest message as a proxy for activity, with a fallback to creation time, and successfully implemented the feature.",
  "brief_summary": "The user requested a 'sort by recency' feature. After an initial implementation based on creation time, the user clarified they meant last update time. Claude then navigated a library limitation by using the last message's timestamp as a proxy for updates, successfully built the feature using `mise`, and updated all relevant documentation.",
