  "brief_summary": "To enhance safety, the user asked to block dangerous commands. Claude updated the `settings.json` to place commands like `kill` on an 'ask' list and `shutdown` on a 'deny' list, and also created a new shell hook to guard against more complex destructive patterns. The changes were then committed and pushed.",
