  "friction_detail": "The implementation faced multiple technical hurdles: an asyncio event loop conflict required refactoring from ThreadPoolExecutor to a subprocess-based approach; accuracy extraction failed due to incorrect log parsing, which required debugging; and a cached embedding dimension mismatch caused a final-stage failure, solved by clearing the cache.",
  "primary_success": "Successfully debugged and implemented a complex, multi-stage evaluation pipeline, solving an `asyncio` event loop conflict by switching from threading to subprocesses, and adding persistent caching for `.eval` files and model outputs.",
  "brief_summary": "The user requested the implementation of a prompt selection pipeline. The agent wrote the code but encountered and fixed several major issues, including an asyncio event loop conflict (solved with subprocesses) and an embedding cache dimension mismatch. It then successfully ran the pipeline for two datasets (GPQA and MATH) with correct, large sample sizes, and improved the system's caching mechanisms along the way.",
