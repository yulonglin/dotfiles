  "friction_detail": "Claude initially confused 'epochs' with 'paraphrases', but the user provided a quick correction which Claude immediately understood and incorporated.",
  "primary_success": "Correctly implementing the `single_epoch` flag in the dataset creation utility and then writing both mock and real-data tests to verify its functionality.",
  "brief_summary": "The user first asked what data is fed to judges, then requested a change to feed single-epoch transcripts. After a minor clarification on terminology, Claude implemented a `single_epoch` flag in the data processing script to control this behavior and wrote tests to confirm the new logic works as expected.",
