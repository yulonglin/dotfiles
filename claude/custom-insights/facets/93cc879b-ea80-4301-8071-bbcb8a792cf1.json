  "friction_detail": "Claude's initial edit to the slides was 'lossy' and removed important data, requiring the user to correct it. The session also required one context refresh.",
  "primary_success": "Corrected a key misleading narrative in a research slide deck. The original claim was 'sandbagging is in code, not explanations', but collaborative debugging revealed that explanations *did* provide a strong signal (67% recall) and that code-structural analysis had failed. This led to a more accurate research story.",
  "brief_summary": "The user identified a misleading claim in a slide deck about USACO sandbagging detection. Through a collaborative investigation of experiment history, Claude and the user discovered the original narrative was wrong: explanations, not code, had provided the best detection signal. Claude corrected the slides, refactored misleading 'bug pattern' terminology in the codebase to 'boundary patterns', and then conducted a spec interview to plan the missing USACO v4.1 accuracy experiments.",
