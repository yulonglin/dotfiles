  "brief_summary": "Starting from a user question about data loss on refresh, the agent diagnosed the cause, planned, and implemented an incremental save feature. During planning, it proactively identified and fixed a file-locking race condition. After implementation, it addressed further issues found by code-review agents, including a path traversal vulnerability, before committing the robust solution.",
