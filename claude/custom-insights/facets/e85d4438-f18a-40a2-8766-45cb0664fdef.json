  "friction_detail": "LaTeX compilation hung, requiring a manual kill and retry with `-interaction=nonstopmode`. A `\\Statex` command in the algorithm block was undefined, which was fixed by creating a custom `\\myStatex` command.",
  "primary_success": "Autonomously writing two complete, multi-page LaTeX workshop papers from a source document, including debugging complex compilation errors and correctly managing file paths and custom style files.",
  "brief_summary": "Following a detailed user plan, Claude created two complete LaTeX workshop papers by adapting a main source document. The process involved setting up infrastructure, writing over 18 pages of new LaTeX, and debugging compilation issues like a hanging `latexmk` process and undefined commands. Both papers were successfully compiled and verified against the plan's requirements.",
