# Strategic Communication Skill

Built on **Chris Voss's FBI hostage negotiation approach**: tactical empathy and emotion labeling as your primary tools, with a warm "positive & playful" default tone.

## When to Use This Skill

- **Negotiating**: Rentals, salaries, contracts, terms with vendors/hotels
- **Making asks**: Requesting resources, time, help from colleagues
- **Declining**: Saying no to requests, opportunities, or offers
- **Changing plans**: Backing out or modifying commitments
- **Navigating tension**: Any situation where emotions are running high
- **Refining messages**: When your draft feels off-tone or unclear

## The Foundation: Tactical Empathy + Labeling

**Rule from Voss: Every fourth thing you say should be a label.**

1. **Recognize their perspective** - imagine yourself in their situation
2. **Identify their emotions** - what are they feeling and why?
3. **Label those emotions explicitly** - "It seems like..." / "It sounds like..." / "You're probably..."

**This is not manipulation. This is demonstrating genuine understanding.**

### Your Default Mode: Positive & Playful

From Voss: "Voice of an easygoing, good-natured person. Relax and smile while talking."

## Core Workflow

### Step 1: Understand Their Emotional Landscape

Before drafting, ask yourself:
1. How does this situation affect them emotionally?
2. What are they afraid of or concerned about?
3. How have my actions impacted them?
4. What do they actually need?

### Step 2: Lead With Tactical Empathy

**Structure**: [Label their emotion] + [Show you understand] + [Your message]

**Example**: "You're probably frustrated that I'm changing plans last minute, especially since you took time off. I'm sorry about that - something unexpected came up."

### Step 3: Use Calibrated Questions

After acknowledging emotions, use "How" and "What" questions:
- "How would [your need] work for you?"
- "What would you need to make this work?"

**Avoid**: "Why" questions (accusatory), "Can you" questions (easy to refuse)

### Step 4: Listen for "That's Right" Not "You're Right"

- **"That's Right"** = Genuine agreement, they feel understood
- **"You're Right"** = Dismissive, they want you to go away

### Step 5: Reality Check

- Did I acknowledge how this affects them emotionally?
- Am I being genuine about their concerns?
- Am I staying warm and collaborative in tone?

## Key Principles From Voss

**1. Label Emotions Constantly**
Pattern: "It seems like..." / "It sounds like..." / "You're probably..."
Then **pause** and let them respond.

**2. Accusation Audit - Name The Worst First**
Say what they might think about you before they can: "You're going to think I'm being flaky..."

**3. "I'm Sorry" Is a Tool, Not Weakness**
Apologize for your impact on them, not for having needs.

**4. Three Types of "Yes"**
Only Commitment Yes matters. Use no-oriented questions: "Would it be crazy to...?"

**5. Slow Down and Smile**
Creates trustworthiness and combats defensiveness.
