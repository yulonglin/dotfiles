# Claude Code Skills Directory
# =============================
# Runtime artifacts created by Claude Code's plugin system:
# 1. Self-referencing symlinks: skills/<name>/<name> (extensionless, circular)
# 2. SKILL.md symlinks: point to agents/*.md or skills/*.md (absolute paths)
#
# Strategy: Track all files with extensions (covers all user content).
# Self-referencing symlinks are extensionless -> stay ignored automatically.
# SKILL.md symlinks are auto-detected by pre-commit hook.
#
# ASSUMPTION: No runtime files with extensions are created in skill subdirs.
# If Claude Code starts creating runtime files here, add specific ignore patterns.

# Ignore everything by default
*

# Track this file
!.gitignore

# Track plugin system directory (needed for extensionless .codex-system-skills.marker)
!.system/
!.system/**

# Allow git to traverse into skill directories

!**/*/

# Track all files with extensions (user content always has extensions)
!**/*.*

# Standalone skill files (technically covered by !**/*.* but explicit for clarity)
!docs-search.md
!task-management.md

# === DENY LIST ===
