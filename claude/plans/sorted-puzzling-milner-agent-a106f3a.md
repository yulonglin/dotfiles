# Plan: Write Trojan Abstract Plan File

## Status: BLOCKED by Plan Mode

Plan mode is currently active, which prevents writing to any file except this plan file. The target file content is fully prepared and ready to write.

## Action Needed

Once plan mode is exited, write the full Trojan Abstract plan content (provided in the user's message) to:

```
/Users/yulong/writing/brainstorming/ideas/20260131-204007-technical-ai-governance-hackathon-projects/plans/plan-trojan-abstract.md
```

The directory already exists (verified — `plan-sleeper-agent-auditor.md` is already there).

## Steps

1. Exit plan mode
2. Write the full plan content to the target file using the Write tool
3. Verify the file was created successfully
