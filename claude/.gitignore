# Claude Code Runtime State (NEVER COMMIT THESE)
#
# These files are managed by Claude Code's plugin system and contain:
# - Absolute paths specific to the current machine/user
# - Plugin installation state that differs per machine
# - Runtime cache that should be regenerated
#
# Committing these files causes:
# - Claude Code startup failures on other machines
# - Hardcoded paths that break portability
# - Plugin loading errors for non-existent paths
#
# If you see these files in `git status`, they were committed by mistake.
# Remove with: git rm --cached <file>
