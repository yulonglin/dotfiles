# Plan: New-Mac App Setup via Brewfile + Toggle TUI + Auth Helpers

Date: 2026-06-16
Branch: `claude/quirky-hypatia-wj5t9g`

## Goal

Make setting up a fresh Mac a one-command, reviewable experience:
- Install the GUI apps you actually use (casks + Mac App Store).
- Browse each app's description and toggle it on/off before installing.
- Reproducible + re-runnable (Brewfile).
- Encode the ChatGPT trust policy (Homebrew only, official casks, **no new taps**, MAS for App Store vendor apps).
- Prune dotfiles cruft that the security policy says to drop.
- Help with the apps that need auth/manual login.

Priority order baked into every decision (from your security note):
**Security > Reliability > Reproducibility > Performance > Novelty.**

## 1. Architecture

```
config/apps.conf          # NEW — single source of truth: one line per app
  └─ generates → config/Brewfile        # brew/cask/mas entries (committed, reproducible)
custom_bins/app-picker    # NEW — gum TUI: browse descriptions, toggle, write Brewfile
install.sh  --apps        # NEW component: bootstrap brew+gum → run picker → brew bundle
scripts/setup/auth-setup  # NEW — interactive post-install auth checklist
```

Why Brewfile (your choice) + a registry:
- `brew bundle` natively handles `brew "x"`, `cask "x"`, and `mas "App", id: N` — one mechanism covers CLI tools, GUI casks, and App Store apps.
- The committed `config/Brewfile` is the reproducible lock-ish artifact the policy asks for.
- `config/apps.conf` keeps descriptions + category + trust tier + auth notes that a raw Brewfile can't hold; the picker reads it and emits the Brewfile.

### `config/apps.conf` schema

```
# method | id           | category   | tier | default | name              | description | auth
cask     | notion        | text       | 1    | true    | Notion            | Notes/docs/wiki                 | login
mas      | 904280696     | tasks      | 2    | true    | Things 3          | GTD task manager (App Store)    | things-cloud
brew     | wakatime-cli  | time       | 2    | false   | WakaTime CLI      | Coding time tracker (API key)   | apikey
```

- **method**: `brew` (formula) / `cask` / `mas` (App Store). **Selection rule (per your policy: MAS > vendor download > cask):** prefer `mas` when the app is on the App Store AND its sandboxed MAS build isn't feature-crippled (gives sandbox/least-privilege + notarization + no cask supply-chain surface). Use `cask` only when the app needs unsandboxed system access (accessibility, automation, system/network extensions, SMC) or isn't on MAS. Safari extensions are always `mas`. Caveat: `mas` re-installs Apple-ID-owned apps, but first acquisition of paid apps (e.g. Things 3) is a one-time GUI step.
- **tier**: 1 = official vendor auto-approve, 2 = mature OSS review, 3 = needs explicit approval (per your policy). Drives a color tag in the TUI; tier-3 items default OFF.
- **default**: initial toggle state.
- **auth**: token for the auth-setup checklist (`login`, `apikey`, `pair-phone`, `safari-ext`, `license`, `none`).

### TUI: `gum` (answers your "which needs no install?")

None of gum/fzf/ratatui preship on a clean Mac, but:
- Homebrew is the *only* hard prereq and `install.sh` already installs it first.
- `gum` is a 1-file brew formula already in your package list and already the engine behind `show_component_menu`.
- ratatui would need a full `cargo build` (heavy, slow on fresh machine).

So: **bootstrap `gum` immediately after Homebrew**, then reuse the existing menu pattern. The picker shows `name — description` rows grouped by category, with a tier tag, full description visible inline (gum) — space toggles, enter confirms, writes `config/Brewfile`. (If you'd prefer a full-description side panel, fzf `--preview` is a drop-in alternative; gum is the lower-friction default.)

| auth | Bitwarden | ✅ or 🛒 | `bitwarden` cask / mas `1352778147` | 1 | Desktop app **has a cask**. Safari extension ships **only** in the MAS build → use mas if you want the Safari ext (covers both) |

| antivirus | Malwarebytes | ✅ | `malwarebytes` | 2 | **optional, default OFF**; lightweight on-demand scanner. **Recommended** AV for personal use |
| antivirus | Trellix | ❌ | — | 3 | Personal install, no cask → checklist manual-install note. **Don't run real-time alongside Malwarebytes.** Recommend skip (heavy enterprise EDR, low value for dev threat model) |

IDs marked *verify* get a `mas search` / `brew info` check during implementation before committing (policy: `brew info` before install, verify vendor/homepage). Safari extensions can be *installed* but must be *enabled* in Safari manually — the auth checklist will list them.

### "settings → dotfiles" (menu bar / accessibility / dock)
These aren't apps — they're system defaults. Already handled by `config/macos_settings.sh`. I'll extend it with:
- Dock: which apps are pinned (set from the installed-apps list) + autohide behaviour.
- Menu bar items (where scriptable; Stats/AlDente handle most).
Treated as a follow-up sub-task, not part of the Brewfile.

## 3. Auth / manual-setup helper

New `scripts/setup/auth-setup` (run after `brew bundle`): an interactive gum checklist that, per app needing setup, prints the action and offers to open the app / URL:

- **git / gh** — already covered (gist sync + `gh auth login`); checklist just verifies.
- **API-key apps (WakaTime)** — wire into existing secrets system (`setup-envrc` / `with-secrets`); no plaintext.
- **GUI logins** (Dropbox, Slack, Spark, Granola, Bitwarden, NordVPN, Tailscale, ChatGPT, Claude, Things Cloud, Spotify) — open app, check off when logged in. Can't be automated (interactive OAuth/passwords) — checklist only.
- **Alfred** — open prefs, point sync folder at Dropbox, apply Powerpack license.
- **Safari extensions** — open Safari → Settings → Extensions, enable uBlock Origin Lite / Bitwarden / 2FAS / Userscripts.
- **VoiceInk** — first-run model download.

No secrets are stored in plaintext; anything key-based flows through the existing SOPS/BWS path.

## 4. Proposed pruning (per-item approval — your choice)

Driven by your policy ("prefer mature, boring"; "never auto-add taps"; "revisit ZeroBrew in 6–12 months"; "cautious with MCP/random tools"):

**APPROVED for removal:**

| # | Remove | Where | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | **zerobrew** | `install.sh` experimental | Experimental pkg mgr; your note says revisit in 6–12mo. `curl\|bash` install. |
| P3 | **Coven** + `brew tap Crazytieguy/tap` | `install.sh` ai-tools | Third-party tap — violates "never auto-add taps". |

**KEEP (you declined):** ty type checker, zotero-mcp-server → so the `experimental` component stays.
`OFFICIAL_PLUGINS` audit deferred (can revisit separately).

---

## 5. Policy documentation

- Extend `claude/rules/supply-chain-security.md` (or add `config/apps.conf` header) with the tier model + "no new taps without approval" + "`brew info` before adding any app".
- Note in `CLAUDE.md` how to add an app (one line in `apps.conf` → re-run picker) and the Brewfile regen flow (`brew bundle dump`-style).
- Optional, not auto-applied: your note prefers `~/code/dotfiles` over `~/.dotfiles`. `DOT_DIR` is auto-detected so nothing breaks either way — I'll mention it but not move the repo.

---

## 6. Files to change

- **NEW** `config/apps.conf` — app registry (the table above).
- **NEW** `config/Brewfile` — generated, committed.
- **NEW** `custom_bins/app-picker` — gum toggle TUI → writes Brewfile.
- **NEW** `scripts/setup/auth-setup` — auth checklist.
- **EDIT** `config.sh` — add `apps` to `INSTALL_REGISTRY`; remove pruned items (pending approval).
- **EDIT** `install.sh` — `--apps` block: bootstrap gum, run picker, `brew bundle --file=config/Brewfile`; remove inline Finicky + pruned experimental/coven blocks.
- **EDIT** `scripts/shared/helpers.sh` — small `brew bundle` + `mas` helpers if needed.
- **EDIT** `claude/rules/supply-chain-security.md`, `CLAUDE.md` — policy + how-to.
- **EDIT** `config/macos_settings.sh` — dock/menu-bar follow-up (optional, can defer).

## 7. Verification

- `mas search` / `brew info` each *verify*-flagged id before committing the Brewfile.
- `brew bundle check --file=config/Brewfile` (dry, on a Mac) — can't run here (Linux container); will gate behind a note for you to run, or validate syntax with a parser.
- `app-picker` run with `--dry-run` to confirm it emits a valid Brewfile without installing.
- Shellcheck the new scripts.

## 8. Resolved decisions

1. **Prune**: zerobrew + Coven/tap only (P1, P3). ty, zotero-mcp, `experimental` component all stay.
2. **Antivirus**: Trellix = university-managed (checklist note, not Brewfile). Malwarebytes = optional cask, default OFF, conflict note.
3. **Optional apps**: Google Drive + WakaTime default OFF (toggle on in picker).
4. **TUI**: gum (bootstrapped after Homebrew). fzf `--preview` remains a drop-in alt.

All open questions resolved — ready to implement on approval.
