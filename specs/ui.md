Let's start by figuring out and revising this doc. Also spin up agents to do web search to figure out what the best practices are, from places like Twitter, Reddit, Hackernews, articles from well-known people like Simon Willinson, etc.

Consider what makes sense and what we should implement:
1. /interview me to figure out what makes sense, or if we should even care about this at all
2. Use agents to summarise the current approaches for the various projects, doing git clones if helpful
3. Let's discuss what makes sense

I imagine it'll be useful for frontend stuff like dashboards for visualising stuff: Vercel, Streamlit, something else?? Personal website at ~/writing/yulonglin.github.io ? Maybe also things like playground to figure out what makes sense, or things like ~/writing/llm-council to ask a group of LLMs for feedback and learn something
