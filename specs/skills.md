Let's start by figuring out and revising this doc. Also spin up agents to do web search to figure out what the best practices are, from places like Twitter, Reddit, Hackernews, articles from well-known people like Simon Willinson, etc.

Consider what makes sense and what we should implement:
1. /interview me to figure out what makes sense, or if we should even care about this at all
2. Use agents to summarise the current approaches for the various projects, doing git clones if helpful
3. Let's discuss what makes sense

The types of things I use coding agents for can be seen from the convo histories. I use them to write papers, run experiments, brainstorm ideas for experiments, learn about things, write messages, write apps, connect/summarise things from Notion/Slack/etc., further optimise my code, do research / lit reviews, find recs/best practices about stuff, the sky is the limit basically

I'm using gemini cli, claude code, codex cli. Also interested in cursor cli, amp code, opencode -- should we even care about these?
